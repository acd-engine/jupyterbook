## Introduction

> The Australian Cultural Data Engine is a multidisciplinary project based at the University of Melbourne that harnesses leading [cultural databases](https://www.acd-engine.org/partners) to analyse cultural production, artistic networks, and the socio-economic implications of arts and cultural data. 

The goal of the Australian Cultural Data Engine (ACDE) is to increase the accessibility and scope of cultural data in Australia. Additionally, it seeks to examine and address any biases, exclusions, or cultural assumptions that may exist within the data, with the aim of utilising high-quality data to provide rich, multilevel analysis and to tell more compelling stories.

In order to achieve the goals stated eariler, it is necessary to have a complete, accurate, and consistent view of the data. The data from various cultural databases need to be combined and harmonised for critical cultural analysis and quantitative analysis. Therefore, the data processing procedures in the ACDE become critical components of this project. 

This section will provide an overview of the crucial steps taken in the ACDE data processing, which include developing a unified data model, establishing the Australian Cultural Data Engine Architecture (ACDEA), as well as designing and implementing the ETL (Extraction, Transformation, Loading) process. Additionally, the future work of data processing will be discussed, as well as other interesting projects found during the implementation of this process.

For the sake of brevity and clarity, here are a list of abbreviations will be used in the following sections.
