### The Circus Oz Living Archive collection

#### Introduction
---
> Built in collaboration with the worldâ€™s oldest contemporary circus company, the Circus Oz Living Archive combines performer interviews and performance videos with audience engagement to create an interactive, immersive environment for experiencing the magic of circus over and over again.

#### Data Processing
---
##### Data Extraction & Exploration

The CircusOz data are manually collected from three data sources, and is provided in an xlsx format. As all the data are merged into one spreadsheet, it requires denormalisation of three distinct entities, namely `person`, `event`, and `venue`, and transformed into a SQLite database for the convenience of understanding the data. 

For the details of constructing the CircusOz database, please refer to this jupyter notebook [circusoz_DBConstruction.ipynb](https://github.com/acd-engine/jupyterbook/blob/main/integration%20notebooks/circusoz_DBConstruction.ipynb).

The following diagram shows the schema of CircusOz data:

##### Data Transformation & Loading

Due to the manual collection process of CircusOz data, it is inevitable that some records may contain typographical errors and duplicate attributes. Therefore, the main goal of the transformation process is to perform deduplication while retaining the unique attributes from the three data sources.

On an entity level, the CircusOz entity projection is listed as follows:

<style>
  /* CSS for zebra-striped table */
  table {
    border-collapse: collapse;
    width: 100%;
  }

  th, td {
    padding: 8px;
  }

  /* Zebra striping */
  tr:nth-child(even) {
    background-color: #f2f2f2;
  }
</style>

| CircusOz Entity (Collection)               | ACDEA Entity |

| person                                     | person       |

| event                                      | event        |
| -                                          | recognition  |
| venue                                      | place        |
| -                                          | organisation |
| -                                          | resource     |
| foreign keys across person, venue and event | relationship |
