## Australian Cultural Data Engine Architecture

### Introduction
---
To construct a comprehensive and consistent view of data from various cultural databases, the development of a unified data model is crucial. The unified data model is named as the Australian Cultural Data Engine Architecture, or ACDEA for short. The ACDEA serves as the foundation effectively for integrating and harmonizing data from multiple data sources. By constructing the ACDEA, insights can be gained into the vaiuos data models that underpin the different cultural databases, thereby helping to clarify the number of entites in each data sources. as well as doing comparison analysis on the definition of entity unit concept in each data source.

It should be noted that the ACDEA is currently only a prototype for integrating existing data sources. As discussions around improving data integration performance and clarifying professional domain definitions continue, and as more data sources are accumulated, the ACDEA may be modified accordingly.

The following sections will begin with a brief overview of the ACDEA, followed by a description of the general procedure of the ACDEA construction workflow.
