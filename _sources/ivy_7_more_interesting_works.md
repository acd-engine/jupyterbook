## More Interesting Works and Cultural Data Sources
In addition to the ACDE project, we found many other interesting digital humanities projects related to cultural data integration and analysis. These projects could inspire further work in this field and help humanities researchers utilize integrated data in new and innovative ways. Here are a few examples:

1. [Map Theatres in Australia](https://circuit.unimelb.edu.au/)
   
   This project is a digital platform that maps the history of Australian theatre from the early colonial period to the present day. It features a searchable database of historical information and multimedia resources, including photographs, playbills, and recordings of performances.

2. [HuNI: Humanities Networked Infrastructure](https://huni.net.au/)
   
   HuNI is a national research infrastructure project that provides a platform for integrating and sharing cultural data from a wide range of sources, including museums, archives, and libraries. It allows researchers to discover new connections between different types of cultural data and to explore complex research questions across multiple disciplines.

In addition to current data sources, we found many other interesting Australian/International cultural data collections that could be integrated into ACDEA. These data collections could boost the existing integrated data as well as  inspire further work in this field. Here are a few examples:

1. [Archibald, Wynne and Sulman Prizes | Art Gallery of NSW](https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/art/prizes/)
   
   This is a collection of art prize data from the Art Gallery of NSW. It contains information about the artists, artworks and judges of the prizes. This data collection could add more value to "recognition" level in ACDEA.

   <br>

2. [Australian and New Zealand Art Sales Digest](https://www.aasd.com.au/)
   
   This is a database of sales of Australian and New Zealand art. It includes information about the artwork, artist, sale date, price and sale location. This data collection could strenthen the structure for "work" level in ACDEA.
   <br>
   <br>

3. [Australian Prints + Printmaking](https://www.printsandprintmaking.gov.au/)
   
   This is an online database of Australian prints and printmaking, maintained by the National Gallery of Australia. It contains information about artists, prints, printmaking techniques, and print collections in Australian museums and galleries. This data collection could add more value to "work", "resource" and "place" level in ACDEA which enrich the data related to visual art domain in ACDE.

4. [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
   
   This is a well-known database of information about movies, television shows, and other productions. It includes information about the cast and crew, production companies, release dates, and ratings. This data collection could enrich the data related to modern film art domain in ACDE.

5. [Miles Lewis' Research DataBases](https://www.mileslewis.net/research-database/index.html)
   
   Miles Lewis' Research Databases: This is a collection of research databases compiled by Professor Miles Lewis, a prominent Australian architectural historian. The databases cover topics such as Australian architectural heritage, post-war modernism, and Australian war memorials. This data collection could boost the data in Architecture domain in ACDE.
