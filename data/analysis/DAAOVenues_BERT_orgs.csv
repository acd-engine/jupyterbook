"Paterson Brothers, Melbourne completed one of their first interior decoration commissions at Villa Alba, Kew in 1884.  This commission included fabrics, valances, tiles, Japanese “leather” paper, furniture from local retailer W.H.

"The Australian Tapestry Workshop enjoys an international reputation as a leader in contemporary tapestry. Established in 1976, it is the only workshop of its kind in Australia and one of only a handful in the world for the production of hand-woven tapestries. Artists worldwide are discovering how this traditional medium can be used in completely new ways, and the Workshop is in the vanguard of this revival.
Using the same techniques employed in Europe since the 15th century, the ATW's skilled weavers work with artists from Australia and overseas to produce tapestries that are known for their vibrancy, technical accomplishment and inventive interpretation. 
Since its inception, the Workshop's philosophy has been to employ weavers trained as artists to enable close collaboration with the artists whose work they are interpreting. Many notable Australian and international artists have collaborated with the Workshop's weavers over the years including Arthur Boyd, Jon Cattapan, John Olsen, Jorn Utzon, David Noonan and Sally Smart.
To date, the Workshop has created more than 400 tapestries ranging from palm-size to monumental. They are woven using the finest Australian wool, which is dyed onsite forming a unique palette of 370 colours. These works hang in significant public and private collections around the world.

"Early 20th century Indigenous Sydney shellworkers. The first recorded commercial sales of shellwork is from the late 1800s. Indigenous women sold their work mainly to white tourists, thus not much has been preserved. Jane and her sister Olive's legacy lives mostly in their legendary reputation.Aboriginal shellworkers lived in the Aboriginal settlement at La Perouse, on the shores of Botany Bay, from the 1890s to the 1950s. The first references to Aboriginal women selling shell baskets at Circular Quay and at La Perouse appear in the 1880s. By the turn of the century shell work by ""Queen Emma"" [Timbery] at the Aboriginal camp at La Perouse was admired when exhibited locally and overseas through mission organisations. Olive and Jane Simms were sisters, grandchildren of Queen Emma. They came from an Aboriginal family at La Perouse renowned for their artefact skills. The men worked wood into boomerangs and the women made shellwork for the passing Sydney tourist trade which still dominates the area at weekends.
The sisters' lives were shaped entirely by La Perouse at the turn of the century when the reserve at the mouth of Botany Bay was opened up (in 1905) as a 'recreational area' accessible by the Sydney tram. Despite the regular traffic of outsiders, the daily life of the Aboriginal community was governed by the state and mediated by the church, in the form of the United Aboriginal Mission. Like other missions located in sites with regular tourists contact such as Hermannsburg and Corranderk, artefact production was conceived as a means of providing some form of economic base. The Methodist missionaries had formerly worked in Fiji and appear to have seen the potential for adapting South Pacific shellwork locally. Collecting shellfish had always been central to coastal people, but this 'La Per shellwork' does not resemble any precontact form. Its shapes are an adaptation of European souvenirs: little boxes in shapes of hearts, miniature shoes, Sydney Harbour Bridges, all made from scrap cardboard, cut, sewn and pasted together with a flour glue and then shelled.
A photograph showing Jane Simms holding a shellwork horseshoe and boomerang she had made appeared in the mission's monthly newsletter in 1929, accompanying an article on La Perouse by Methodist missionary James Jago. Jago was temporarily serving at the La Perouse station while Miss Baker, the missionary who had worked there for twenty-four years, was taking a 'well-earned' three-month holiday. Already despairing of the moral well-being of the majority of his temporary charges, Jago noted: 'Neither is it easy for our people to be Christians here, as we know what close touch with our civilization means to them... The work goes on ... there are the faithful few who daily attend morning prayers... Miss Jane Simms, the seller of shellwork, is one of these prayer helpers. _'_
When shellwork is spoken about, it is always represented as a social and female process: 'When we were young our mothers would take us to the beach to collect shells. We would walk along the shoreline after the tide went down to collect shells that were not broken and shell grit. The women would sit around in a circle and sort the shells into sizes and colours. The different shells they used were muttonfish, starries, beachies, buttonies, cowrie, pearl, fan, conk, small cockle and small pippies. _'_
Two of Olive and Jane Simms' nieces, Jean Stewart and Margie Dixon, remember their aunts' dedication, professionalism and expertise in their art. Jean Stewart, recalled combing the beaches of 'La Per', Maroubra and Cronulla with her aunts to find the shells from which they made necklaces and pairs of miniature ornamental slippers. Margie Dixon, spoke about, 'Auntie Ollie every Saturday afternoon doing her shellwork, she liked to be on her own. She had her special designs that none else knew. Up to the 1950s she was doing it.'
Other living shellers from La Perouse who were also (still or again?) working in the 1990s include *Lola Ryan* and her sister, Mavis Longbottom (dead by 2001) and *Rose Timbery* and her sister *Esme Timbery* .
Virtually nothing has survived of Olive and Jane Simms's shellwork, only their reputation as some of the best 'shellers' from the Aboriginal community at La Perouse. It is not surprising that their work only exists as a memory for it was made to be sold to white tourists and was not collected by museums, then interested only in 'authentic' Aboriginal objects. What therefore can be retrieved of this hybrid, post-contact practice, and what values does it hold for both the local Aboriginal community and for the wider community who bought it as

"Tasmanian furniture design and manufacturer. Est. in Launceston in 1946, Tiffany sold wholesale, then after 1982, began direct sales. The principals were James Guy (b.1916) and Laurel Guy who began designing and manufacturing tubular steel work, later moving into timber and upholstered furniture. [information supplied by Geoffrey Clarke].Citation from ""QUEEN VICTORIA MUSEUM AND ART GALLERY.""
Tiffany (Nu Steel) Furniture Company, a large Tasmanian manufacturer of domestic and commercial furniture, was established in 1946 by James Norris Guy as a family business. From humble beginnings in a small shed near the wharves at 45 Foster Street, Launceston, it employed 85 staff at its peak, developing its Kings Meadows site, to which it moved in 1962, as both factory and showroom. It began selling directly to the public in 1982, although outlets opened in Burnie and Glenorchy (Hobart) a few years later were relatively short-lived. Surviving various difficulties over some 45 years, the Company remained wholly Tasmanian until it was forced into receivership in December 1992.
James Guy, founder and later general manager of the Company, was born in Launceston on 20 September 1916, the fourth of eleven children. Leaving school at the age of 14 during the Depression, he became a mechanic and metal worker in his brother Frank's car business. Towards the end of the Second World War, James Guy became interested in tubular steel furniture, setting up his own business with his wife Laurel and trading as J N & L M Guy. The first maker of steel furniture and original distributor of laminex in Tasmania, Guy decided to branch into the manufacture of timber furniture. The name Tiffany Furniture was registered in the mid 1950s. Early mass production of fire screens, laminex furniture, and stackable school furniture variously attracted buyers on the mainland, eg Myer's, Victoria, and in Tasmania, eg Coogan's, Hobart. The Company was the first to use television extensively for advertising purposes in Tasmania.
By the 1980s Tiffany (Nu Steel) Furniture Pty Ltd was equipped for the production of furniture in solid timber, timber laminations, timber veneer, steel frame fabrications and full upholstery techniques. It had its own design team, but also contracted independent designers and manufactured to design specifications for large projects, eg Sheraton Hotel, Hobart. The Company marketed successfully to homes, hotels, hospitals, and offices, and also exported its products to New Zealand. A Tasmanian finalist in the 1984 National Small Business Awards, in 1991 it was also the first Tasmanian furniture manufacturer to be awarded a contract to supply Federal Government departments and other agencies.

"PVI Collective formed in the UK in 1998 and are now permanently based in Australia, PVI Collective are an independent new media arts ensemble who produce cross-platform art work combining elements of performance, video and installation with public acts of intervention. The group is currently comprised of six core members, each with varying arts practice backgrounds that help shape the multidisciplinary nature of PVI's work. Under the creative direction of Kelli McCluskey and Steve Bull, the collective's socio-critical arts practice confronts notions of 'life mediated by technology' by seeking to infiltrate public domains and actively engage audiences within the artwork.
Projects have included an interactive web event enlisting members of the public as elite surveillance operatives, a car sticker campaign targeting the most 'stealable cars' in Australia, and an alternative site seeing tour of Australian cities via a 22-seater media-customised bus. Often with a dissenting focus, PVI's work is driven by a need to provoke notions of acceptable behaviour and complacency towards mechanisms for social control, that permeate through mass media.",PVI Collective,1,pvi collective formed uk permanently based australia pvi collective independent new media arts ensemble produce cross platform art work combining elements performance video installation public acts intervention group currently comprised six core members varying arts practice backgrounds help shape multidisciplinary nature pvi work creative direction kelli mccluskey steve bull collective socio critical arts practice confronts notions life mediated technology seeking infiltrate public domains actively engage audiences within artwork projects included interactive web event enlisting members public elite surveillance operatives car sticker campaign targeting stealable cars australia alternative site seeing tour australian cities via seater media customised bus often dissenting focus pvi work driven need provoke notions acceptable behaviour complacency towards mechanisms social control permeate mass media,pvi collective formed uk permanently based australia pvi collective independent new media arts ensemble produce cross platform art work combining elements performance video installation public acts intervention group currently comprised six core members varying arts practice backgrounds help shape multidisciplinary nature pvi work creative direction kelli mccluskey steve bull collective socio critical arts practice confronts notions life mediated technology seeking infiltrate public domains actively engage audiences within artwork projects included interactive web event enlisting members public elite surveillance operatives car sticker campaign targeting stealable cars australia alternative site seeing tour australian cities via seater media customised bus often dissenting focus pvi work driven need provoke notions acceptable behaviour complacency towards mechanisms social control permeate mass media,3

"Raymond Rodgers and Marion Solomon are creative and life partners who work together in Bairnsdale, Victoria. They are associated with the East Gippsland Aboriginal Arts Corporation. Raymond Rodgers and Marion (Bubby-Girl) Solomon are partners in life and in art. Together they also have four children. Solomon was born in Bairnsdale in 1971. Her mother, Glenis Solomon (nee Hood), is Gunai/Kurnai, her father, Albert Solomon, from the Monero people. Rodgers, a Yita Yita descendant, was born in 1977 in Robinvale, the son of Edward and Kathy Rodgers. He moved to Lakes Entrance before settling with Solomon in Bairnsdale.  While Solomon travelled across both her lands and learnt about her culture with her family as they worked as seasonal pickers, the young Rodgers spent time with his father, Eddie Rodgers, going into the bush to find the raw material for spears, clap sticks and boomerangs as well as didgeridoos. Rodgers and Solomon have a strong sense of family. Rodgers says: ""My dad loves it when we bring the grandchildren home so he can show them what to do and how to find wood"". The artists work together to turn detailed designs into works of wood burning art. Their works also incorporate paint into their finished design. The designs include the line markings that typify Victorian work and often depict both land and water creatures that are enmeshed in the artists' lands, culture and lives. Their works are regularly on display at East Gippsland Aboriginal Arts Corporation exhibitions and permanent display at the Bairnsdale Court House where the artists won a prize at the opening of the Koori Court in 2007. During 2007 their work was chosen for reproduction by the Indigenous Unit of the City of Melbourne.","Rodgers/Solomon, Raymond and Marion",1,raymond rodgers marion solomon creative life partners work together bairnsdale victoria associated east gippsland aboriginal arts corporation raymond rodgers marion bubby girl solomon partners life art together also four children solomon born bairnsdale mother glenis solomon nee hood gunai kurnai father albert solomon monero people rodgers yita yita descendant born robinvale son edward kathy rodgers moved lakes entrance settling solomon bairnsdale solomon travelled across lands learnt culture family worked seasonal pickers young rodgers spent time father eddie rodgers going bush find raw material spears clap sticks boomerangs well didgeridoos rodgers solomon strong sense family rodgers says dad loves bring grandchildren home show find wood artists work together turn detailed designs works wood burning art works also incorporate paint finished design designs include line markings typify victorian work often depict land water creatures enmeshed artists lands culture lives works regularly display east gippsland aboriginal arts corporation exhibitions permanent display bairnsdale court house artists prize opening koori court work chosen reproduction indigenous unit city melbourne,raymond rodgers marion solomon creative life partners work together bairnsdale victoria associated east gippsland aboriginal arts corporation raymond rodgers marion bubby girl solomon partners life art together also four children solomon born bairnsdale mother glenis solomon nee hood gunai kurnai father albert solomon monero people rodgers yita yita descendant born robinvale son edward kathy rodgers moved lakes entrance settling solomon bairnsdale solomon travelled across lands learnt culture family worked seasonal pickers young rodgers spent time father eddie rodgers going bush find raw material spears clap sticks boomerangs well didgeridoos rodgers solomon strong sense family rodgers says dad loves bring grandchildren home show find wood artists work together turn detailed designs works wood burning art works also incorporate paint finished design designs include line markings typify victorian work often depict land water creatures enmeshed artists lands culture lives works regularly display east gippsland aboriginal arts corporation exhibitions permanent display bairnsdale court house artists prize opening koori court work chosen reproduction indigenous unit city melbourne,5

"Colonial Victorian Stained Glass craftsmen 'Ferguson & Urie' 1853 - 1899.
Also see: http://fergusonandurie.wordpress.comColonial Victoria’s leading stained glass window firm “Ferguson & Urie” started in North Melbourne in 1853, initially by three men who emigrated from Ayrshire, Scotland between late 1852 and early 1853. These were brothers James & David Ferguson, the sons of Master Slater and Glazier James Ferguson Snr from Wallacetown, Ayrshire and James Urie, the son of William Urie from Kilmarnock, Ayrshire. In the Scottish Census Records of March 1851, James Urie age 22, was shown as being a visitor to James Ferguson Jnr’s (age 33) home at John Street Wallacetown. Both men’s professions were listed as Slater and Glaziers and as James Ferguson was 11 years older than Urie, the age difference leads us to believe that Urie may have been an apprentice of Ferguson earlier.
The Ferguson brothers and James Urie started their business as Plumbers, Glaziers and Decorators from premises in Curzon Street near the north east corner of the North Melbourne Benevolent Asylum. One of their earliest business advertisements appeared in the Melbourne Argus newspaper in August 1853 advertising lead lattice windows for churches and cottages, as well as for zinc spouting, piping, revolving cowls for chimneys and galvanised roofing products. In late 1854 they showed some of their workmanship at the Victorian Exhibition and were awarded certificates for plumbers' work and stained windows. This appears to be the earliest indication of their foray into stained glass artwork, likely to have been done by James Urie himself.
In early January 1857, David Ferguson decided to leave the partnership after only four years in the Colony and return to Scotland. On the 30th of January, 1857 a notice was placed in the Victorian Government Gazette advising of the dissolution of his involvement in the partnership of Ferguson & Urie, however the business continued under the same name between James Ferguson and James Urie.
By the late 1850s Ferguson & Urie were concentrating the business solely on glazing, lead light and stained glass windows and had many commissions for windows in churches and other significant public buildings and private mansions. In 1861 they displayed specimens of their 'Ornamental Glazing in Lead' at the Victorian Exhibition.
In early 1862 Ferguson & Urie engaged the services of John Lamb Lyon, a fellow Scot living in Maldon in the central Victorian goldfields district who had immigrated to Australia in 1861. He was an experienced stained glass artist who had been an apprentice of Kearney & Co glass painters in Scotland and later worked with Ward & Hughes, London glass painters to Queen Victoria.
By 1863 it would seem that Ferguson & Urie had the monopoly in the design and manufacture of stained glass windows in the Colony and were admirably competing with the works of English stained glass being imported into the Colony. Possibly the earliest known extant windows designed and manufactured by Ferguson & Urie are the triple-light window in St Pauls
Ballarat (c. 1861) and the window commissioned in 1862 for George Coppin’s Apollo Music Hall in Bourke Street Melbourne. It was known as the “Shakespeare” window and bequeathed to the State Library of Victoria in 1960 by George Coppin’s daughter Lucy.
In 1863 Ferguson & Urie recruited stained glass artist David Relph Drape. Drape initially trained as a decorative artist and worked mainly on church restoration projects in England, during which time he developed his architectural skills along with painting and first class work in stained glass art. Drape had been living in Maldon from around 1858 about the same time as Lyon, and it is thought that they may have collaborated in the design and manufacture of the two-light window above the entrance to the Holy Trinity church in Maldon in 1863. However its manufacture was likely to have been undertaken by the Ferguson & Urie workshops in Melbourne. Drape also designed the Holy Trinity church.
In February 1867 advertisements for Ferguson & Urie began appearing as “Ferguson,Urie, and Lyon”. This is the earliest indication that Lyon had been installed as a partner. By this time the business name of Ferguson & Urie was very well known and their workmanship was in demand outside of Victoria, for instance in Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand.
In August 1873, after just over ten years with Ferguson & Urie, Lyon left the partnership and on the 27th he sold his house and its contents at Dudley Street, North Melbourne in preparation for his move to Sydney. On the 29th a notice appeared in the Victorian Government Gazette advising of the official dissolution of the partnership and the business name reverted to Ferguson & Urie. Lyon then took up partnership with an old friend Daniel Cottier to become Lyon, Cottier & Co Sydney.
In 1874 an advertisement appeared in the Argus indicating that Ferguson & Urie now had premises in Collins Street Melbourne and for many years the Argus advertised ‘…Rolled Plate, Cathedral, and coloured glass…Stained glass and lead lights at Curzon Street and 10 Collins Street East’.
In 1875 Ferguson & Urie exhibited their stained glass work at the Intercolonial Exhibition and were awarded a silver medal and First Prize. The medal is known to be in the possession of a James Urie descendant along with a handmade poster with photographs presented to the founding partners by the employees. It depicts the images of James Ferguson, James Urie, employees and photos of their business premises at Yarra Bank South, Curzon Street and Collins Street in 1887.
Around 1884, George James Coates was apprenticed to Ferguson & Urie at the age of fifteen. Coates was born in Emerald Hill on 8th August 1869 and studied at the North Melbourne School of Design and attended evening classes at the National Gallery School under Frederick McCubbin. His peers included the Lindsay brothers, Max Meldrum and George Bell. Coates later married accomplished artist Dora Meeson and in April 1919 he became an official war artist to the Australian Government. His photo also appears in the Ferguson & Urie employee poster.
The Colony's appetite for stained glass artwork was by this time reaching its peak and the Ferguson & Urie business had grown considerably. In August 1884 the Melbourne Argus reported “Messrs Ferguson and Urie’s New Premises” was near completion at 10 Collins Street. The new building was seven stories (including basement) and was one of the first in Melbourne to be built with material known as “Hydraulic Freestone” (early concrete). The building was described in the Argus as having a “bright and cheerful façade” due to the lighter colour and elaborate patterns employed in the freestone moulding.
On the 31st of January 1888 a fire broke out at the Ferguson & Urie Yarra Bank South glass store and workshops, destroying the greater part of the premises. The fire was reported in newspapers as far away as Tasmania.
In August 1889 Ferguson & Urie began running advertisements in the Argus announcing that the 10 Collins Street premises were for sale. Around this time Collins Street was also undergoing a process of re-numbering due to the massive expansion of buildings in the street and the Collins Street building was known at “281 & 283 (Late 10), Collins St East”, although simple advertisements in the Argus continued to refer to 10 Collins Street East until 1892.
On the 21st of July 1890 partner James Urie died at the age of 62. Outside of the business he had been a Justice of the Peace as well as a Councillor of Flemington and Kensington from August 1886 to August 1888, and Mayor from August 1887 to August 1888.
By April 1891 Ferguson & Urie had vacated their Collins Street premises and retreated to their warehouse at 100 Franklin Street, three doors west of Elizabeth Street. Increasing competition in the stained glass trade along with the stock market crash in 1890 was now undoubtedly taking a toll on the business and advertisements for Ferguson & Urie began to decline in the latter half of 1892 and then ceased to appear altogether.
On the 17th of April 1894, remaining partner James Ferguson died at the age of 76, beginning the final decline in the Ferguson & Urie story. The business name continued for another five years possibly at the helm of Ferguson & Urie’s eldest sons, James Ferguson Jnr and William Urie until July 1899 when the business’s entire stock in trade at the 100 Franklin premises went up for unreserved sale. In early September the premises were advertised for rent.
On November 14th 1899 the flagship building of the Ferguson and Urie business at No. 10 Collins street went under the auctioneers hammer at “12 O’Clock Noon” as reported in the Argus Newspaper. Dividends were declared for the shareholders in the business on the 21st of July 1899, and on the 21st of February 1901 the Citizens Life Assurance Company which was next door to the Ferguson & Urie building, advertised that they had purchased the property for an undisclosed sum. The building was eventually demolished in the early 1900s.
The Ferguson & Urie business was concluded after a 46 year history. Throughout the Ferguson & Urie history, thousands of stained glass windows were created and installed in churches, public buildings and private mansions and homes around Melbourne and regional Victoria and well as in New South Wales, Queensland, Tasmania and South Australia. There are also three known examples of their work in New Zealand. A significant number of these windows can still be seen today in many of the heritage listed buildings and churches of all denominations throughout Victoria and interstate. It is possible that others were destroyed over the years as buildings were demolished prior to the establishment of the Victorian Heritage Act.",Ferguson & Urie,1,colonial victorian stained glass

"Fashion label established by Cathy Braid and Kirsten Ainsworth in 2003. Fabrics and patterns were handcrafted by Pakistani women.Cathy Braid and Kirsten Ainsworth grew up in NSW, and moved to north-western Pakistan in 2003.
The following year they launched Caravana, sometimes referred to as ‘a label with a conscience’. These luxury garments for the Western market derived their unique handcrafted character from the traditional skills of Pakistani women.
Braid and Ainsworth’s shared vision in establishing the Caravana label was to empower these talented women through employment. From a small start, the two worked with local organisations to set up a network of ten centres. The local environment provides strong design inspiration and each item carries the personal imprint of both designer and maker.
In 2007 Caravana works were included in the Powerhouse Museum exhibition 'Smart works: design and the handmade'.",Caravana,1,fashion label established cathy braid kirsten ainsworth fabrics patterns handcrafted pakistani women cathy braid kirsten ainsworth grew nsw moved north western pakistan following year launched caravana sometimes referred label conscience luxury garments western market derived unique handcrafted character traditional skills pakistani women braid ainsworth shared vision establishing caravana label empower talented women employment small start two worked local organisations set network ten centres local environment provides strong design inspiration item carries personal imprint designer maker caravana works included powerhouse museum exhibition smart works design handmade,fashion label established cathy braid kirsten ainsworth fabrics patterns handcrafted pakistani women cathy braid kirsten ainsworth grew nsw moved north western pakistan following year launched caravana sometimes referred label conscience luxury garments western market derived unique handcrafted character traditional skills pakistani women braid ainsworth shared vision establishing caravana label empower talented women employment small start two worked local organisations set network ten centres local environment provides strong design inspiration item carries personal imprint designer maker caravana works included powerhouse museum exhibition smart works design handmade,3

"The Hotham Street Ladies consists of five women including Cassandra Chilton, Molly O’Shaugnessy, Sarah Parkes, Caroline Price and Lyndal Walker, who collectively produce art together. Their works span across a range of mediums including street art, installations, public art, recipe books and cakes with their primary materials including icing, fondant, buttercream icing, royal icing, food colouring and gum-paste. Working collaboratively, their practice embraces themes of home life, feminism and craft in a humorous and critical manner.
Known for their provocative street art and public art commissions, as well as their unconventional entries into the Royal Melbourne Show cake competitions, the Ladies have been causing a stir on the local Melbourne art scene by pushing the boundaries and raising issues of gender and feminism through their works. Their latest and most ambitious project, At Home with the Hotham Street Ladies (2013), was exhibited in the National Gallery of Victoria foyer and consisted of two large lounge and dining rooms and a connecting hall. The corridor's floor featured a nine-metre-long hall-runner, made entirely of hardened icing in many colours as well as a full dining table of dirty dishes and food scraps- entirely constructed from icing. At Home with the Hotham Street Ladies is concerned with notions of nostalgia and themes about domesticity, consumerism and the possibilities of artistic expression. 
One of their most provocative works, You Beaut (2013), exhibited in the male toilets at the Victorian College of the Arts, features a large-scale iced vagina leading to a pool of menstrual blood. Despite it’s graphic nature, the work is surprisingly un-intimidating due to the connotations associated with the medium of icing. You Beaut, successfully pushes the boundaries existing within contemporary society and raises clear notions of gender equality and female sexuality. For the Hotham Street Ladies, icing is not only used as a material but is used conceptually. Their works provoke conversation about women and their place in society whilst appearing sweet, pretty and hardly threatening. As Sarah Parkes stated, “we try to be subversive, but everything we make tends to end up looking quite pretty.” However, their installations are heavily layered with notions of gender inequality and successfully provoke conversation regarding the conflict surrounding working women existing in contemporary society.  
In 2010 the group participated in the annual Royal Agricultural Society of Victoria, cake-decorating competition at the Royal Melbourne Show. Their cake, entitled Miss Havisham, inspired by the wedding cake in Charles Dicken’s Great Expectations, was disqualified from the Royal Melbourne Show as it was “in bad taste” and “should be pleasing to the eye.” Moldy, eaten away by vermin, and overrun by maggots, the work represents the decaying institution of marriage. Their participation in such a rigid and typically female dominated competition, proves quite interesting. On one hand it appears they are mocking the establishment and the practice, yet simultaneously their involvement communicates the ability for women to participate in such typically feminine crafts whilst proving to be provocative feminist artists. 
With their unconventional use of materials, the Hotham Street Ladies have successfully created an intriguing art practice that successfully questions the role of women in a contemporary society, the meaning of domesticity and issues regarding gender roles. Making the statement that female worth is not judged on the cleanliness of a household or whether their cakes or installations are ‘pleasing to the eye,’ their works successfully communicate that women can participate in typical domestic crafts without being subservient.",Hotham Street Ladies,1,hotham street ladies consists five women including cassandra chilton molly shaugnessy sarah parkes

"Commercial printers in Sydney and Melbourne, specialising in prints of Australian urban and regional landscapes.engravers and lithographers, had a printery at Sydney in the late 1840s. In 1848 they published _Panorama of Australia_ containing 12 views engraved in London, mostly after *John Skinner Prout* . On 10 June 1852, Quarrill & Co.'s 'Stock-in-trade' was auctioned at their premises in Kent Street, Sydney, including 'some of the finest presses ever brought into the colony ... with a large quantity of engraved steel and copper plates, among which there are a number of well executed views of each of the Australian colonies, engraved by English artists, after drawings by Prout'.
The Quarrills then set up in Melbourne. The firm showed several 'specimens of artistic lithography and commercial Engraving' at the 1854 Melbourne Exhibition, including _Corio Bay, Geelong_ and _Portrait of Clint the Ventriloquist_ ( *Scipio Clint* ), undoubtedly local productions. In February 1854 the _Armchair_ noted: 'we have received another packet of Melbourne sketches by E. Thomas [q.v.] lithographed by Quarrill. They are six in number, four being the most familiar spots in town, including the _Argus_ office with its crowds of news-seekers in front, and the other two Canvass-town and Sandridge [Port Melbourne]. They are all cleverly executed, the _Argus_ and Prince's Bridge being the best. The price of the whole series in an illustrated wrapper, is only five shillings, and we are glad to find that they are being extensively sold for transmission to England'.

"The Society of Interior Designers of Australia began ca. 1950 in Sydney and incorporated in 1964. Some of the goals of the organisation included ethical issues, education activities and exhibitions. SIDA had chapters in Victoria and Queensland with affiliated members nation. Their archives are held by Caroline Simpson Library & Research Collection, Sydney Living Museums.Margaret Lord’s account of the founding states, “In 1950 seven interior decorators met at Marion Best’s house in [the Sydney suburb of] Woollahra to discuss the formation of a society or association which would help to raise the standard of interior design in Australia. These seven were Mary White, Don Johnson, Edmund Dykes, Don Shaw, Stuart Low and myself (Margaret Lord) and our hostess Marion Best. As a result of our talk that evening a list of possible members was made out […] and a meeting was held in the ballroom at Meriooola […] in Edgecliff Road [Bellevue Hill].” 
There is an alternative narrative to the founding of SIDA. Cecily Adams states that in 1951, she was invited by Don Johnson to join a “small group of interior decorators … to discuss the formation of a Society of Interior Designers”; they held their first meeting in Merioola, a suburban villa in Woollahra. At this time, the house was an active artists’ colony supported by the arts patron Chica Lowe.   
In 1964, the SIDA incorporated in NSW and Catriona Quinn reports that the incorporation document was signed on “… 17th July, 1964 by Mary White (President, 1963-64), Leslie Walford, Thomas (Warren) Harding, Merle du Boulay, Malcolm Forbes, Margaret Wardell (Lord), Marion Best and Barbara Campbell (Bridges).  The document sets out some of the goals of the organization including ethical issues, education activities and exhibitions. Upon incorporation, the SIDA established professional criteria for active membership requiring completion of a “…four year course of college level in design, and […] not less that two years fulltime practical experience in a recognised establishment…”. 
The Sydney-based chapter of SIDA formed the core of the Society with 91 members in 1975, including a single member in New Zealand. In 1975, the membership in Victoria was 21, with Queensland’s 16 members, Western Australia’s 4 members, South Australia’s 3 members and the Northern Territory’s single member. This is the only member listing found to date and it is reproduced in Appendix 4.
More recently, further documents associated with SIDA have come to light in a donation of the papers of Leslie Walford and as these documents are catalogued by Catriona Quinn and other scholars at the Caroline Simpson Library and Research Collection, Historic Houses Trust of NSW (HHT), more information of the evolution of the organisation may be available.

"The Finke River Mission (later known as the Hermannsburg Mission) was established in 1877 by Lutheran Missionaries Pastor Kemp and Schwarz. It stands at the base of Mount Hermannsburg, on the banks of the Finke River; 125km west of Alice Springs. The settlement was named after the German town; Hermannsburg where the missionaries had trained. The mission’s intention was to provide religious instruction, a European education, and employment to the indigenous people of the area. 
 
Employment included working on nearby stations as a ringer or station hand, for Afghan cameleers delivering goods to Hermannsburg, blacksmithing, carpentry and leather work, among others. Pastor FW (Friedrich Wilhelm) Albrecht established the beginnings of a craft trade with the aim of improving 
the economy of the impoverished mission. The venture proved successful and formed the foundations for a larger art movement which followed.
 
In 1932 Melbourne artists; Rex Battarbee and John Gardner first visited Hermannsburg on a painting expedition to record the central Australian landscape in watercolour. In 1934 Battarbee returned to Hermannsburg and was invited to exhibit his works at the Hermannsburg school. Many Indigenous residents of the mission saw the exhibition, including a Western Arrarnta man; Albert Namatjira. Inspired by the works on display Namatjira requested painting lessons from Battarbee and accompanied him on painting expeditions.
 
Albert Namatjira become renowned for his watercolour landscapes, quickly surpassing his teacher. In 1939 the Art Gallery of South Australia acquired Namatjira’s Illum-Baura (Haasts Bluff) 1939.

"Bush Video were the main group of people using video as an experimental art form in the early 1970s in Australia.Bush Video were the main group of people using video as an experimental art form in the early 1970s in Australia. It was set up by the experimental filmmaker Mick Glasheen, who had been using video since 1968. He was approached by the organisers of the Nimbin Aquarius Festival – to be held in the May university holidays of 1973 – to document the festival and provide video access to festival participants. Glasheen and another filmmaker, Joseph el Khourey, joined forces with the Australian Union of Students, producers of the Nimbin festival, and applied for funding to build a cable network through the town of Nimbin to set up a video centre. The idea was to record festival events and distribute them via cable to the many gathering places throughout the town, and the Festival grounds, for other participants to watch at a later time. This was the very first experiment in cable television in Australia.
Bush Video gathered a large group of like-minded artists, filmmakers and technologists to help realise the project. When they returned to Sydney, they moved into the studio Glasheen had already established in Ultimo, and this became the gathering place for all members of the group. More people got involved including a young electronics enthusiast known as Ariel. It was a loose, collective organisation built on the spirit of collaboration and explored most of the areas in which video has been used since.
Glasheen had already been working with colour video and recognised its electronic potential in the glowing flows of video feedback. He had also been recording small pieces of computer animation to film, which were made with the assistance of Doug Richardson, who built a computer graphics facility based on a DEC PDP-8 minicomputer at the University of Sydney. Once Bush Video returned from Nimbin the electronic project took off. A wall of TV monitors and a video-mixing capability was established in the studio, with cameras for recording everything from dance and music performances to video feedback and Lissajous figures on oscilloscopes.
The equipment Bush Video used to make the video ranged from an early computer graphics system built by Doug Richardson, to images made with oscilloscopes, or produced with modified monitors and video feedback. To create video feedback a camera is pointed at a monitor and played back into the monitor so it is looking at itself. This produces a loop of video signal with a delay caused by the time it takes to get the monitor to display the image – not very long really.
Glasheen describes the attraction this electronic video art held for him:
‘I was drawn to the organic nature of it’ it seemed to me that video and electronic art is really an image of’ energy! It’s live light energy! Electromagnetic fields that are made visible. You know, there’s this glowing cathode tube with an image there that was alive. So I just felt that there’s life there, this new life-form, that could be felt when you’re doing video feedback.’Conversation with Mick Glasheen recorded on 14 May 2005 at Palm Beach
The studio process often involved nights of live mixdowns with as many videotapes and electronic-image-generation devices as possible, brought into play over a period of recording. These sessions could get pretty wild and lots of interesting images were produced, though few coherent finished works were made. One of the more finished works, MetaVideo Programming, was commissioned by the National Gallery of Australia for its collection of experimental art. This and several other pieces were shown by Bush Video at the Computers and Electronics in the Arts exhibition in Canberra.
Like all other participants in the exhibition, Bush Video were invited to contribute by Doug Richardson. They had a van for their equipment and a Geodesic Dome Glasheen built, which they lived in while travelling. The Dome was set up by the lake in Commonwealth Park as accommodation for the core members who went to Canberra for Australia 75.
The Bush Video installation took form as a wall of monitors on which all the video work, tape playbacks of Bush Video pieces and live performances mixed either by Bush Video or though John Hansen’s video synthesiser, were shown to the public. The exhibition opened as colour television was launched in Australia, so for many members of the public it was their first experience of it. They kept up an almost continuous stream of wildly abstract video for the audience.
This was a period of high experimentation – artists working with electronics did not know what the possibilities were. They had access to the smallest details of the technology; every single op amp, if in the analogue, and AND gate, if in the digital, or writing one’s own assembler code if working directly with a microprocessor.
Video was also highly experimental. The technology available to artists was still new, very primitive and unstable. The kinds of images that were being generated were often a result of quirks in the equipment and could be very difficult to record.
For the Bush Video artists, the use of video feedback was a representation of the way in which technology might become a ‘living thing’. This could be seen in the way video feedback became self-sustaining, and often quite uniform in spiraling forms that inevitably led to comparison with the illustrations of D’Arcy Thompson in his book On Growth and Form. The slightest change of lighting, camera setting, or the images it was mixed with, could trigger the feedback off into new forms.
Using wipes and luminance keys the mixer could take layers of images – oscilloscope displays, Lissajous figures, animated wire-frame geometric drawings done on Doug Richardson’s computer, and the streaming echoes of visual feedback – and combine them into collections of images redolent with ideas about the geometry of space and consciousness. They were searching for a new language for the new ideas that came with cybernetics, geodesic domes, Buckminster Fuller and Marshall McLuhan, and of course, the newly accessible electronic technologies.
Here video is not just a narrative tool but an attempt to create a new language with images as coherent living ideas. These images influenced ways of thinking about consciousness and memory and new approaches to metaphysics (this was after all the 70s, when everyone was starting to think differently thanks to the ground work of the hippies in the 60s). It was felt that somehow the images being produced were a direct emulation of flow of consciousness and the deeper understanding achieved through meditation and other spiritual activities (and, of course, LSD). This was a period of what we might think of as ‘spiritual technology’.",Bush Video,1,bush video main group people using video experimental art form early australia bush video main group people using

"One of these, it is uncertain which, painted some small, naive watercolours  in an album of poems compiled by Frances Lapham.sketchers(?), were two of the children of Samuel Lapham, superintendent of convicts on Maria Island, Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) in 1842-78, and Susan, née Butler.

"Professional portrait photographer's in New Zealand, Sydney, and Melbourne, and painter of miniatures on ivory.painter and professional photographer and professional photographer respectively, were born at Wainui, New Zealand on 4 January 1881 and 6 October 1882, the eldest and second daughters of the seven children of Robert Walter Moore, a sawyer and farmer, and Sarah Jane, née Hellyer. May studied at Elam School of Art and Design in about 1900 and was working as a portrait artist in Auckland from about 1904; in 1907 she sold pen and ink portrait sketches at the New Zealand International Exhibition in Christchurch. Mina worked as a teacher in country schools. By 1908 May was established in Wellington as a portraitist, sub-letting studio space from another photographer. The sisters decided to buy him out for £170, a considerable sum at the time. May understood that to succeed at the upper end of the portrait photography market required stylish presentation, aesthetics and studio promotion. The Moore sisters introduced new bromide papers, fancy mounting and lighting, and quickly established a reputation for quality portraiture. May was always interested in the theatre, and many of the sisters' studio portraits were of visual and performing artists. Once established, the Moore studio style varied little over the years. Based on head and shoulder studies with strong high side-lighting picking out half the face, plain dark backgrounds concentrated attention on the faces. Despite a largely uniform mood of seriousness or intensity, a strong sense of the sitter's presence and individuality came through.
After about four years the sisters relocated to Australia. May visited Sydney in 1910 and worked from a space in the _Bulletin_ building, where she photographed *Livingston Hopkins* , *David Low* , the *Lindsays* and other _Bulletin_ artists. By June 1911 she had opened her first Sydney studio; May joined her that year. From 1912 to 1915 a studio in their joint names was listed at 416 George Street; the Moore's portrait of *Thea Proctor* (AGNSW) is dated 1912. In 1913 they opened a Melbourne branch, which Mina managed, finding a studio in J. & N. Tait's new Auditorium Building in Collins Street through their theatrical contacts. May operated alone from 418 George Street, Sydney, then from 139 King Street (c.1918-24). The New Zealand work appears to have been always issued under May's name, but the Australian work usually had a joint stam
On 13 July 1915, May married Henry Hammon (Harry) Wilkes, a dentist with literary interests who later managed the studio. Mina married a poet and company executive, William Alexander Tainsh, on 20 December 1916 in Melbourne. They lived at Warrandyte, Victoria, where Mina established close friendships with a number of women artists including *Clara Southern* and *Jo Sweatman* . She sold the Melbourne studio to *Ruth Hollick* in about 1918, after the birth of the first of her three children. A late commission, in 1927, was a presentation book of photographs for the Shell Oil Company, where her husband worked.
May continued to use the joint stamp after Mina's retirement and remained active until about 1928. One of her studio assistants in 1925 was *Elizabeth Mahony* . She also painted miniatures on ivory, which she exhibited with the NSW Society of Women Painters. She died prematurely of cancer on 10 June 1931, without issue. Mina died at Croydon on 30 January 1957, survived by her husband, son and two daughters.

"Nineteenth-century watercolourists, husband and wife, of whom little is known. Many of their works are landscapes.painters, exhibited at the Sydney Mechanics School of Arts in 1857. Mrs Thornton showed five of her own works and Home Scene and Broughly Castle, listed as having been painted by Mr Thornton. Two of her paintings were miniatures on ivory (Van Dyck and Tambourine Girl); Child's Head, Study of Head and Lame Leading the Blind were 'crayons' (pastels). At the same time Mr Thornton exhibited his wife's watercolours of Loch Maree and Loch Lomond and her miniatures on ivory of St Peter's (Rome) and Van Dyck's wife. (He also showed a watercolour of Inverary painted by 'Williams'.) The subject-matter suggests that the couple had come from Scotland, possibly quite recently. In 1869 C. Thornton signed and dated a well-executed watercolour, North Shore from Mosman (SU, Schofield Bequest) and in May 1954 James R. Lawson auctioned a landscape painting of Geneva, Switzerland, by W. Thornton, from the estate of Mrs J.A. Schofield. Perhaps these are the couple's initials. This entry is a stub.

"Future Feminist Archive is an ongoing archive, addressing strategies of recovering lost information, promoting the legacies of local feminist art activists and building a solid platform for the future. FFA is convened by Contemporary Art and Feminism.Future Feminist Archive
FFA is an ongoing archive, addressing strategies of recovering lost information about art and feminism, promoting the legacies of local feminist art activists and building a solid platform for the future.
Convened by Contemporary Art and Feminism, Future Feminist Archive (FFA) poses a series of hypothetical questions. These range from the grand do we need a specialist feminist art archive and what forms could it take, to practical considerations of recovering lost archives, stock-taking existing records, and generating new ideas for curating and archiving.
To introduce these questions Future Feminist Archive (FFA) opened with a symposium at Art Gallery of NSW on 7 March 2015 and an accompanying set of (Contemporary Art & Feminism-associated) exhibitions across Sydney and in Adelaide, Brisbane, Hobart and Melbourne.
FFA held Symposia in Wollongong, Dubbo, Bathurst, Lismore and in Sydney at AGNSW National Art Archive and engaged with the art and design histories of regional New South Wales with in order to (re)value cultural work by women in the past, and to investigate their legacy for present and future feminist cultural politics.
With support from The NSW government arts funding body (Arts NSW) nine female artists and collectives worked alongside with diverse arts entities and experts to create a variety of engagements with the archive. Their reports were presented at the exhibition 'Future Feminist Archive Report' at The Cross Art Projects, Kings Cross, Sydney 16th April-7th May 2016.",Future Feminist Archive,1,future feminist archive ongoing archive addressing strategies recovering lost information promoting legacies local feminist art activists building solid platform future ffa convened contemporary art feminism future feminist archive ffa ongoing archive addressing strategies recovering lost information art feminism promoting legacies local feminist art activists building solid platform future convened contemporary art feminism future feminist archive ffa poses series hypothetical questions range grand need specialist feminist art archive forms could take practical considerations recovering lost archives stock taking existing records generating new ideas curating archiving introduce questions future feminist archive ffa opened symposium art gallery nsw march accompanying set contemporary art feminism associated exhibitions across sydney adelaide brisbane hobart melbourne ffa held symposia wollongong dubbo bathurst lismore sydney agnsw national art archive engaged art design histories regional new south wales order value cultural work women past investigate legacy present future feminist cultural politics support nsw government arts funding body arts nsw nine female artists collectives worked alongside diverse arts entities experts create variety engagements archive reports presented exhibition future feminist archive report cross art projects kings cross sydney th april th may,future feminist archive ongoing archive addressing strategies recovering lost information promoting legacies local feminist art activists building solid platform future ffa convened contemporary art feminism future feminist archive ffa ongoing archive addressing strategies recovering lost information art feminism promoting legacies local feminist art activists building solid platform future convened contemporary art feminism future feminist archive ffa poses series hypothetical questions range grand need specialist feminist art archive forms could take practical considerations recovering lost archives stock taking existing records generating new ideas curating archiving introduce questions future feminist archive ffa opened symposium art gallery nsw march accompanying set contemporary art feminism associated exhibitions across sydney adelaide brisbane hobart melbourne ffa held symposia wollongong dubbo bathurst lismore sydney agnsw national art archive engaged art design histories regional new south wales order value cultural work women past investigate legacy present future feminist cultural politics support nsw government arts funding body arts nsw nine female artists collectives worked alongside diverse arts entities experts create variety engagements archive reports presented exhibition future feminist archive report cross art projects kings cross sydney th april th may,2

"Collaborative jewellery studio established by Blanche Tilden and Phoebe Porter in Melbourne in 2005.Jewellers Phoebe Porter and Blanche Tilden met after Porter was awarded the Australia Council Emerging Artist Mentorship to work with Tilden for a three month period. Finding that their interests and passions were in accord the pair established Studio Hacienda in Melbourne in 2005. Both have degrees from the Australian National University School of Art, where they studied gold and silversmithing, and glass. 
Tilden’s inspiration comes from the industrial age and its mass production techniques. Porter’s work experiences have fuelled her ability to develop tools and processes. They are able to make some of their own tools and also use specialist industries for making multiples of their prototyped components.
Both have also experienced the value of mentorship, Tilden with Susan Cohn, and Porter with Tilden. In the studio each continues their own individual practice. However, Tilden’s experience, for example, has broadened Porter’s understanding of serial production, while Porter’s computer-aided drawing skills have introduced Tilden to the benefits of electron wire cutting.

"Dinosaur Designs established in 1985 is a collaboration between three jewellery designers, Liane Rossler, Louise Olsen and Stephen Ormandy.The qualities of the handmade have been central to the work of Dinosaur Designs since it was established in Sydney by Louise Olsen, Stephen Ormandy and Liane Rossler in 1985.
In 1986 the three began producing experimental resin jewellery. Dinosaur Designs steadfastly continues to produce its now extensive range of homewares and jewellery in-house. The company manages its own stores in Sydney, Melbourne and New York and distributes to selected retailers around the world.
Casting in resin allows the creation of multiple pieces while retaining the hand-modelled feel of the original prototypes. Many of the casting techniques can only be done by hand. Working directly with dozens of creative assistants in-house allows Dinosaur Designs to achieve a form of mass hand production that offers a successful alternative to conventional manufacturing.

"One of Australia's oldest Aboriginal art centres. It began as an arts workshop established on the Ernabella Aboriginal Mission in South Australia in 1948. Since then it has fostered a range of artistic and crafts-based practices, including rug-making, batik, ceramics and painting.In the late 1940s, an arts workshop was set up at the Ernabella Aboriginal Mission in northern South Australia. It provides a continuing opportunity for local women to both earn income and communicate their culture through rugs, batik and wooden works.
From 1996 artists have applied their designs to ceramics. They worked closely with Robin Best and JamFactory Contemporary Craft and Design, in Adelaide. More recently Geoff Crispin has encouraged artists to use manufacturing processes that are effective and easy to manage.
In 2002 Ernabella’s textiles also took a new direction. A project co-ordinated by Pamille Berg translates batik designs into rugs manufactured in China through the companies Korda Bros and Tai Ping.

The technology was developed to be wearable, providing a more intuitive human computer interface. This in turn offered an alternative approach to the experience of live electronic music performance, for both performers and audience. In a performance context, the audience experiences movement of the performer's hands and bodies as controlling sonic environment.
Each performer wore eight flex-sensors strapped to the fingers. Movement of the sensors on the fingers is detected and generates signal, which is sent via cabling running along the arms to the micro-controllers. The micro-controllers convert signal to data using ADC. This is passed over extended USB connections to a Macintosh G4 PowerBook running Python scripting. The Python code interprets each of the performer data streams and interpolates the data into a composition framework and the output is sent via OSC to a second laptop running SuperCollider3.

"Although the photographic firm of Metcalf and Glaister had only a short life it was productive as tjheir work is widely distributed.The photographic partnership of Metcalf and Glaister, which was active in Brisbane for only a short time succeeded John Watsons Photographic Gallery on 28 April 1875. The business was uniquely connected to the American photographer Thomas Shelton Glaister (fl 1854-70 ) who was active in Sydney for many years  as Daniel F Metcalf was his stepson and Thomas Skelton Middleton Glaister his son ― both trained with him. In addition the former premises in Queen Street was also managed by John Watson on behalf of their father. 
They promoted their credentials in an advertisement very shortly therafter and:
Desire[ed]  to state that, having just returned from n four-years' visit to the United States, where they have had considerable experience in the most celebrated Galleries of Sun Francisco, New York, &c., they are prepared to execute PHOTO-PORTRAITS in all the Newest and Latest Styles in Berlin, Rembrandt, and Shadow Lights, all in the finest Berlin and Satin finish.(1).
 
Very soon after they established their business in Queen Street they scored something of a coup as they were commissioned to photograph the Governor of Queensland, Sir William Cairns. No doubt they were pleased with the newspaper report of work of which:  
no photo-graphic establishment in the world need feel ashamed. It is, of course, a vivid likeness, but it is in addition, in every detail of photographic work, as near perfection as any we have seen, and the establishment that can turn out such triumphs of the art is a credit to the colony. We are glad, though by no means surprised, to learn that Messrs. Metcalf and Glaister have more orders than they can easily find time to execute.(2)
The business tried their skills in different fields: the photographs of Queensland machinery in the 1877 New South Wales Intercolonial Exhibition (for which they received a ‘highly commended’) was their work (3) 
Even though the young Glaister died of accidental poisoning in 1877 (his funeral was held on 9 August)the business continued under both names until at least August, 1878 whhen it was recorded that a Mrs Bennett  recieved a commendation for her colouring of photographs in the 1878 Queensland National Agricultural and Industrial Association Exhibition. 
The studio continued with another partner for a few more years as Bennet and Metcalf and finally Bennett himself before the equipment and furnishing and was auctioned by John W Todd on 19 March 1880. The stock included 15,000 negatives taken over the life of various businesses which was purchased by riva lphotographers, Mathewson and Co.

Their alias echoes the names of the russian spies in the 1960's animated tv series 'The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show'. The two artists originate from Germany and Australia respectively and both had solo careers before they began collaborating. Since then they have explored the human condition through the mediums of photography, film, mixed-media and text. In particular, they have been concerned with themes of fear and anxiety and with the private imagination. Exhibitions include 'I took a deep breath...' at the 2007 Biennale of Electronic Arts Perth (BEAP).

"Professional photographers, operated the London Portrait Saloon, also known as Milligan Brothers photography business in Sydney, specialising in cartes-de-visite, portraits and miniature photographs which they set into brooches.professional photographers, operated the London Portrait Saloon (soon known as Milligan Brothers) at 230 Pitt Street, Sydney, from at least June 1862 (when they advertised superior portraits in a case from 3s 6d). Like many other Sydney photographers, they claimed to have the cheapest photographs in town, especially cartes-de-visite 'for sending home'. They also copied portraits and took miniature photographs which they set into brooches. In July 1862 G.A. Green exhibited model boats in their studio.
By October 1862 the Milligans were at *J.W. Denslow* 's former portrait gallery in King Street, offering first-class portraits at reduced prices and advertising for an assistant 'who understands Photographic Printing'. A hand-coloured, quarter-plate ambrotype of an unknown woman taken during this period survives (c.1864, University of Sydney). In April 1865 Milligan Brothers advertised a series of 'instantaneous' photographs taken at the unveiling of William Theed's statue of the late Prince Consort which were available either as 30 x 25 cm full-plate ambrotypes, cartes-de-visite or stereo prints. One representing 'the scene at the moment when the statue was uncovered' was reproduced as an engraving in the _Illustrated London News_ on 11 August 1866.
In August 1865 Milligan Brothers opened a second studio at 396 George Street, the remodelled photographic gallery of *Liddell* and *Blitz* , where they were offering portrait photographs 'with all the latest improvements, at the lowest possible price'. Included for an extra 6d in a shilling pamphlet from the Caxton Printing Office, _A Complete Report of the Examination in the Alleged Murder Case of the Late Henry Kinder..._ , advertised in the _Sydney Morning Herald_ in December, were 'FOUR PHOTOGRAPH PORTRAITS by MESSRS. MILLIGAN BROTHERS' of the victim, his wife, Maria Helen, their dentist and Henry's murderer Henry Louis Bertrand and Bertrand's wife, Jane - 'TRUE PORTRAITS of the persons concerned, which it would have been impossible to obtain by any other process than of photography'. These very ordinary carte-de-visite portraits sold in large numbers and sets survive.
In January 1866 Milligan Brothers advertised that copies of the group photograph they had taken at the Fire Company's picnic were available at their King Street studio (the George Street branch had closed). From about 1868 until 1871, when the studio was taken over by W.H. Crago (another photographer), Joseph was sole proprietor at King Street. Then he moved north. A Mr Milligan, presumably Joseph, was in partnership with *William Boag* in a travelling photography business in Queensland for a short time in 1872. They advertised as 'Boag and Milligan from Sydney'.",Joseph Charles and Thomas Milligan,1,professional photographers operated london portrait saloon also known milligan brothers photography business sydney specialising cartes de visite portraits miniature photographs set brooches professional photographers operated london portrait saloon soon known milligan brothers pitt street sydney least june advertised superior portraits case like many sydney photographers claimed cheapest photographs town especially cartes de visite sending home also copied portraits took miniature photographs set brooches july g green exhibited model boats studio october milligans j w denslow former portrait gallery king street offering first class portraits reduced prices advertising assistant understands photographic printing hand coloured quarter plate ambrotype unknown woman taken period survives c university sydney april milligan brothers advertised series instantaneous photographs taken unveiling william theed statue late prince consort available either x cm full plate ambrotypes cartes de visite stereo prints one representing scene moment statue uncovered reproduced engraving illustrated london news august august milligan brothers opened second studio george street remodelled photographic gallery liddell blitz offering portrait photographs latest improvements lowest possible price included extra shilling pamphlet caxton printing office complete report examination alleged murder case late henry kinder advertised sydney morning herald december four photograph portraits messrs milligan brothers victim wife maria helen dentist henry murderer henry louis bertrand bertrand wife jane true portraits persons concerned would impossible obtain process photography ordinary carte de visite portraits sold large numbers sets survive january milligan brothers advertised copies group photograph taken fire company picnic available king street studio george street branch closed studio taken w h crago another photographer joseph sole proprietor king street moved north mr milligan presumably joseph partnership william boag travelling photography business queensland short time advertised boag milligan sydney,professional photographers operated london portrait saloon also known milligan brothers photography business sydney specialising cartes de visite portraits miniature photographs set brooches professional photographers operated london portrait saloon soon known milligan brothers pitt street sydney least june advertised superior portraits case like many sydney photographers claimed cheapest photographs town especially cartes de visite sending home also copied portraits took miniature photographs set brooches july g green exhibited model boats studio october milligans j w denslow former portrait gallery king street offering first class portraits reduced prices advertising assistant understands photographic printing hand coloured quarter plate ambrotype unknown woman taken period survives c university sydney april milligan brothers advertised series instantaneous photographs taken unveiling william theed statue late prince consort available either x cm full plate ambrotypes cartes de visite stereo prints one representing scene moment statue uncovered reproduced engraving illustrated london news august august milligan brothers opened second studio george street remodelled photographic gallery liddell blitz offering portrait photographs latest improvements lowest possible price included extra shilling pamphlet caxton printing office complete report examination alleged murder case late henry kinder advertised sydney morning herald december four photograph portraits messrs milligan brothers victim wife maria helen dentist henry murderer henry louis bertrand bertrand wife jane true portraits persons concerned would impossible obtain process photography ordinary carte de visite portraits sold large numbers sets survive january milligan brothers advertised copies group photograph taken fire company picnic available king street studio george street branch closed studio taken w h crago another photographer joseph sole proprietor king street moved north mr milligan presumably joseph partnership william boag travelling photography business queensland short time advertised boag milligan sydney,5

"Husband and wife Marc and Gillie Schattner are international award winning artists and Archibald Prize finalists who have been painting together for the last 15 years. Most of their artwork appears as diptychs. They work collaboratively on the same art piece and have had solo exhibitions in Sydney, New York, Singapore, Hong Kong and Belgium.Husband and wife Marc and Gillie Schattner are international award winning artists and Archibald Prize finalists. Gillie, born in London in 1965 and Marc born in Melbourne in 1961 have been painting together for the last 15 years and have exhibited their art all over the world. Most of their artwork appears as diptychs. They work collaboratively on the same art piece combining their talent to arrive at a single vision. Every aspect of the art piece has both their minds and hands on it, reflecting their individual passions and influences in life.  Marc Schattner studied Graphic Design at Swinburne, Melbourne. Gillie Schattner is a self-taught artist. They have had solo exhibitions in Sydney, New York, Singapore, Hong Kong and Belgium. ARTIST STATEMENT: Their art meshes figurative expressionism and Pop Art to explore themes of contentment and happiness.   Gillie and Marc are fascinated by the things that give us pleasure, the things that make us happy, the things that make life worth living, and they make art which embodies that quest.   Gillie and Marc Schattner's art draws on their work in the fields of graphic design and advertising, as well as Gillie's experiences working as a registered nurse.  They have worked with the Smile Foundation, The Black Dog Institute and Australian Red Cross Blood Service.  They are also portrait artists, and were recent finalists in the Archibald Prize. Specialising in children, pets and celebrities. Their subjects include Rhonda Birchmore, Scarlett Johannson, John Konrad, Archbishop Pell, Dr Harry Cooper, Jimmy Little, and the late Peter Brock.  Marc and Gillie have had over 30 solo exhibitions.  Drawing on their backgrounds in advertising and graphic design, Gillie and Marc use typical elements of commercial art, product packaging and advertising to create artworks which are pure Pop.   Gillie and Marc's spattered acrylic diptychs are inspired by their love of the Pop Art movement - especially artists such as Andy Warhol, David Hockney, and Burton Morris - and are also a response to the four years they spent living in New York. Their work Modern addiction also includes a range of sculptures by Gillie and Marc Schattner. This work is again inspired by popular culture, taking its imagery from advertising, graphic design and the world of everyday objects, blowing them up into larger than life images, and disrupting the perfectly smooth surfaces of advertising through their use of highly-textured brushwork.","Schattner, Gillie and Marc",1,husband wife marc gillie schattner international award winning artists archibald prize finalists painting together last years artwork appears diptychs work collaboratively art piece solo exhibitions sydney new york singapore hong kong belgium husband wife marc gillie schattner international award winning artists archibald prize finalists gillie born london marc born melbourne painting together last years exhibited art world artwork appears diptychs work collaboratively art piece combining talent arrive single vision every aspect art piece minds hands reflecting individual passions influences life marc schattner studied graphic design swinburne melbourne gillie schattner self taught artist solo exhibitions sydney new york singapore hong kong belgium artist statement art meshes figurative expressionism pop art explore themes contentment happiness gillie marc fascinated things give us pleasure things make us happy things make life worth living make art embodies quest gillie marc schattner art draws work fields graphic design advertising well gillie experiences working registered nurse worked smile foundation black dog institute australian red cross blood service also portrait artists recent finalists archibald prize specialising children pets celebrities subjects include rhonda birchmore scarlett johannson john konrad archbishop pell dr harry cooper jimmy little late peter brock marc gillie solo exhibitions drawing backgrounds advertising graphic design gillie marc use typical elements commercial art product packaging advertising create artworks pure pop gillie marc spattered acrylic diptychs inspired love pop art movement especially artists andy warhol david hockney burton morris also response four years spent living new york work modern addiction also includes range sculptures gillie marc schattner work inspired popular culture taking imagery advertising graphic design world everyday objects blowing larger life images disrupting perfectly smooth surfaces advertising use highly textured brushwork,husband wife marc gillie schattner international award winning artists archibald prize finalists painting together last years artwork appears diptychs work collaboratively art piece solo exhibitions sydney new york singapore hong kong belgium husband wife marc gillie schattner international award winning artists archibald prize finalists gillie born london marc born melbourne painting together last years exhibited art world artwork appears diptychs work collaboratively art piece combining talent arrive single vision every aspect art piece minds hands reflecting individual passions influences life marc schattner studied graphic design swinburne melbourne gillie schattner self taught artist solo exhibitions sydney new york singapore hong kong belgium artist statement art meshes figurative expressionism pop art explore themes contentment happiness gillie marc fascinated things give us pleasure things make us happy things make life worth living make art embodies quest gillie marc schattner art draws work fields graphic design advertising well gillie experiences working registered nurse worked smile foundation black dog institute australian red cross blood service also portrait artists recent finalists archibald prize specialising children pets celebrities subjects include rhonda birchmore scarlett johannson john konrad archbishop pell dr harry cooper jimmy little late peter brock marc gillie solo exhibitions drawing backgrounds advertising graphic design gillie marc use typical elements commercial art product packaging advertising create artworks pure pop gillie marc spattered acrylic diptychs inspired love pop art movement especially artists andy warhol david hockney burton morris also response four years spent living new york work modern addiction also includes range sculptures gillie marc schattner work inspired popular culture taking imagery advertising graphic design world everyday objects blowing larger life images disrupting perfectly smooth surfaces advertising use highly textured brushwork,5

"Four sisters, all sketchers and flower painters, of whom Margaret and Maria were the most prolific. Other works include views of Sydney and Newcastle.sketchers and flower painters, were daughters of John Thacker of Berkshire who established the successful Sydney firm of Thacker, Mason & Company, merchants. They came to Sydney from London in the _Kelso_ with their parents and two other sisters, Ann and Eliza, arriving on 6 May 1842. The Mitchell Library holds two volumes of finely detailed botanical watercolours on rice paper painted by the Thacker sisters. With the exception of the _Blue Water Lily_ , all are believed to have been drawn before 1853 from native flowers in the Sydney area. Stylistically they are extremely similar and can be attributed to individuals only by the initials that appear in the lower right-hand corner of each page. The majority are by Margaret and Maria, who gave the volumes to their niece, Frances Hamilton, in 1895. Some appear to be initialled 'I.F.T.' (Isabelle) or 'J.F.T.' (Jane). Jane drew the competent pencil _Their House, Sydney_ (National Library of Australia [NLA]) and Margaret painted sepia wash views (Mitchell Library). A wash drawing captioned 'The residence of Edward and Annie Hamilton' (NLA) is annotated as having being sketched by Maria and finished by Jane.
Two volumes of well-executed views of New South Wales by Margaret and Maria, done in pencil, ink and wash or sepia watercolour (c.1850-53), are also in the Mitchell Library with some photographs of their drawings included in the first volume. Several watercolours depict views of the property Collaroy, near Cassilis, New South Wales, managed between 1839 and 1855 by Ann Thacker's husband, Edward William Terrick Hamilton (subsequently chancellor of Sydney University and first agent-general for New South Wales) and his brother Captain H.G. Hamilton. Views of Sydney include _Cliff near the South Head, Port Jackson_ (sepia watercolour) and _View from Lighthouse, Sydney_ (sepia watercolour and pen). Two views of Newcastle in ink and wash - _Newcastle Cathedral_ (9 December 1850) and _Newcastle_ (December 1850) - and a view of _Liverpool Range_ (1849) are the only dated works in the volumes. None is signed.
The Thacker sisters studied with *Conrad Martens* in 1846-47. On 16 October 1846 Martens noted in his account book that he had received £16.10s for drawing lessons from 'the Misses Thacker' for three months, a sum that would have covered five individual students. Since he gave discounts for groups, it is likely that all six sisters learned from him. On 8 January 1847, however, Martens noted that only two of the Misses Thacker were taking lessons the following quarter, presumably Margaret and Maria, the most artistically prolific.",Margaret Maria Jane and Isabelle Thacker,1,four sisters sketchers flower painters margaret maria prolific works include views sydney newcastle sketchers flower painters daughters john thacker berkshire established successful sydney firm thacker mason company merchants came sydney london kelso parents two sisters ann eliza arriving may mitchell library holds two volumes finely detailed botanical watercolours rice paper painted thacker sisters exception blue water lily believed drawn native flowers sydney area stylistically extremely similar attributed individuals initials appear lower right hand corner page majority margaret maria gave volumes niece frances hamilton appear initialled f isabelle j f jane jane drew competent pencil house sydney national library australia nla margaret painted sepia wash views mitchell library wash drawing captioned residence edward annie hamilton nla annotated sketched maria finished jane two volumes well executed views new south wales margaret maria done pencil ink wash sepia watercolour c also mitchell library photographs drawings included first volume several watercolours depict views property collaroy near cassilis new south wales managed ann thacker husband edward william terrick hamilton subsequently chancellor sydney university first agent general new south wales brother captain h g hamilton views sydney include cliff near south head port jackson sepia watercolour view lighthouse sydney sepia watercolour pen two views newcastle ink wash newcastle cathedral december newcastle december view liverpool range dated works volumes none signed thacker sisters studied conrad martens october martens noted account book received drawing lessons misses thacker three months sum would covered five individual students since gave discounts groups likely six sisters learned january however martens noted two misses thacker taking lessons following quarter presumably margaret maria artistically prolific,four sisters sketchers flower painters margaret maria prolific works include views sydney newcastle sketchers flower painters daughters john thacker berkshire established successful sydney firm thacker mason company merchants came sydney london kelso parents two sisters ann eliza arriving may mitchell library holds two volumes finely detailed botanical watercolours rice paper painted thacker sisters exception blue water lily believed drawn native flowers sydney area stylistically extremely similar attributed individuals initials appear lower right hand corner page majority margaret maria gave volumes niece frances hamilton appear initialled f isabelle j f jane jane drew competent pencil house sydney national library australia nla margaret painted sepia wash views mitchell library wash drawing captioned residence edward annie hamilton nla annotated sketched maria finished jane two volumes well executed views new south wales margaret maria done pencil ink wash sepia watercolour c also mitchell library photographs drawings included first volume several watercolours depict views property collaroy near cassilis new south wales managed ann thacker husband edward william terrick hamilton subsequently chancellor sydney university first agent general new south wales brother captain h g hamilton views sydney include cliff near south head port jackson sepia watercolour view lighthouse sydney sepia watercolour pen two views newcastle ink wash newcastle cathedral december newcastle december view liverpool range dated works volumes none signed thacker sisters studied conrad martens october martens noted account book received drawing lessons misses thacker three months sum would covered five individual students since gave discounts groups likely six sisters learned january however martens noted two misses thacker taking lessons following quarter presumably margaret maria artistically prolific,5
"The Interior Design Association of Australia (IDAA)
Perhaps inspired by the Victorian chapter of the ASDI, in 1948, Melbourne Institute of Technology students formed the Interior Design Association of Australia (IDAA). [In the first year of its establishment, the IDAA gained a membership of some 32 members: 24 from Vic., 3 from NSW, 3 from the ACT and 2 from SA.].  Jack Crow was its first president and Ron Opie as treasurer. They wrote letters to schools promoting the new discipline. Early members of the IDAA included Keera and Bill Le Lievre, D. H. Bill, J. L. Delbridge, W. Hardacre, and Joan Stewart, secretary. Jack Crow was a member of both SDI (Society of Designers for Industry) and IDAA. 
Bill Le Liver’s SIDA-sponsored interview noted, “During the Olympic Games [in 1956], the IDAA had [student] rooms in Bourke Street […].

"The Jam Factory was established by the South Australian government in 1973 and initially embraced glass, ceramics, leather, textiles and furniture. In 1992, the organisation confined its practices to metal design and furniture.The facility also provides rental studios for independent designers/makers.Our History [https://www.jamfactory.com.au/pages/about]
Since establishment as an initiative of the Dunstan government in 1973, JamFactory has remained at the forefront of development in craft and design.
Originally located in an historic old jam factory on Payneham Road in St Peters, Adelaide, the organisation began as craft training workshops, galleries, shop and artist’s studios, before moving to its current purpose built Morphett Street facility in the heart of Adelaide’s West End Arts Precinct in 1992.
The original workshops focused on the areas of glass, ceramics, leather, textiles and jewellery. These areas of focus were reviewed when the organisation moved to Morphett Street and saw the textile and leather workshops close, jewellery expand to metal design and the opening of a furniture design studio.
The facility at Morphett Street features JamFactory’s flagship retail store, renovated by renowned designer Khai Liew in 2010, 2 gallery spaces and 4 fully equipped studios in ceramics, glass, furniture and metal.

"Professional photographers inadvertently associated with the legal battle and commercial rivalry between Antoine François Jean Claudet and Richard Beard over the patent for daguerreotypes. The duo advertised their business boasting superior results and offered lower prices than their competitors in Charlotte Place, opposite Lyon's Auction Mart, also giving lessons in photography, only to disappear.professional photographers, stated that they were from the Royal Adelaide Gallery of Arts and Sciences, the Strand, London, an establishment patronised by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, when they offered their Royal Patent Photographic Portraits to Sydney. The Troods' licence to take photographs (and presumably their equipment) would have been acquired from Antoine François Jean Claudet, proprietor of the Adelaide Gallery (established 1841), and the Troods also claimed to have worked in Paris. Immediately before arriving at Sydney in December 1843, they were travelling around Northern Ireland, 'astonishing the good people of Belfast with that modern miracle-working wonder, Photography' before moving on to Limerick.
Claudet, who had been producing daguerreotypes in London since 1840, had set up his Adelaide Gallery as a commercial enterprise in opposition to Richard Beard's Regent Street Gallery at the Royal Polytechnic Institute (established March 1841), and Beard was the patentee from whom *George Baron Goodman* purchased his photographic licence and equipment before making his triumphant daguerreotype procession through the Australian colonies, beginning at Sydney in November 1842. Back at London Beard instituted legal proceedings against Claudet in 1842 (not resolved until 1847 when Beard won), and the bitter rivalry of these two commercial photographic pioneers was to be played out in miniature in colonial Sydney, with Goodman (Beard re-enacted) emerging as the clear winner in a battle of which he feigned ignorance. The Troods disappeared into oblivion or, perhaps, the backwoods of Victoria.
A year after Goodman had opened his Sydney studio and apparently saturated the local market, Messrs Trood were offering plain and coloured photographs of 'busts, paintings, groups and views' as well as portraits. They were willing to colour and fix portraits previously taken (by Goodman) in the colony for 6s 6d 'if considered of sufficient merit'. They boasted that their European experience enabled them to present to the colonial public 'talent of such an order as must throw the attempts of any who may have preceded them entirely into the shade' and that their 'mezzotinto' portraits would outstrip any recent Sydney photographs, 'as opposite as beauty to deformity'. Their fixing process rendered their photographs 'PERMANENT FOR AGES - a process hitherto unknown in Sydney' (this was probably true). Finally, they said that their coloured photographic portraits, 'the very latest novelty... will be found to possess (to use the words of the London press) ""such exquisite subtilty [sic] of touch and tone as might fill a Vandyke or a Lawrence at once with delight and despair""'. This last quote from the London _Observer_ had been invoked the previous year by Goodman - the specific target, of course, of these claims to superiority!
*Edward Barlow* , who guaranteed that his watercolour miniature and pencil portraits actually resembled their subjects, responded to the Troods' arrival by denouncing the 'Burlesquaographic' nature of photographic portraits. Photography, he claimed, 'has entirely _failed all over the world_ , for the insensible motion of the sitter, and other physical defects inherent in ... the machine, totally prevents it ever competing with works of real art ... [T]he only successful use to which it could be applied .... is to represent the portraits of the DEAD ... As to Messrs C. & J. Trood pretending to do the thing better [than Goodman], let them be told that talent has nothing to do with Photography, for any Doctor's boy, after an hour's information, can do it easily as a Sweep can print his sooty hand on a white-washed wall'. The Troods, who agreed that photography had indeed been 'burlesqued' before their arrival in the colony, publicly accused Barlow (who boasted of not owning a camera) of sour grapes.
The Troods operated from Charlotte Place, opposite Lyon's Auction Mart, and their portraits cost from 1 guinea to £1 10s each according to size. At a guinea their standard daguerreotype was cheaper than Goodman's since their price included the morocco case and possibly some colouring (Goodman is not known to have coloured his daguerreotypes). They also gave lessons in photography. Early in February 1844 the Troods were advertising that they could remain in Sydney for only a limited period; then they disappeared, presumably moving on to other British colonies. Goodman returned to Sydney from Van Diemen's Land in March and never referred to their visit in any way. But he did acquire a better camera, and his surviving, stabilised, daguerreotypes date only from the following year.
Perhaps the Troods had come to Sydney because they were relatives of Thomas Trood, proprietor of the Albion Printing Office in King Street, and it is possible that at least one of them stayed in Australia and re-entered his former profession after many years or, alternatively, later sent a relative to the colonies. Alan Davies has found a carte-de-visite, which cannot be earlier than the 1860s, from a photographer called Trood of Foster Street, Sale, Victoria.",C. and J.

It was established under a capable teacher, Frederick Sterne who changed the three year Decorator course into a four year diploma Interior Design course. In the same year the students decided to form an organisation which they called the Interior Design Association of Australia. The Association held monthly meetings with Jack Crow as its first president and Ron Opie as treasurer. Based on information drawn from an interview with Joan Stewart, 10 November 2010, she states that they wrote letters to schools promoting the new discipline. Early members of the IDAA included Keera and Bill Lelievre, D. H. Bill, J. L. Delbridge, W. Hardacre, and Joan Stewart. Jack was a member of both SDI and IDAA. He comments ""By this time (1952) the organisation had grown in strength and we leased our own meeting rooms in the heart of town. We gave lectures to the public on aspects of Interior Design. During the Arts Festival associated with the Olympic Games we held an exhibition of our members' work, which was visited by a number of overseas visitors.
During an SDI dinner, in 1958, to which several members of the IDAA were invited, it was suggested that they might care to join the SDI as its members were considering the possibility of developing an Institute. Following the incorporation of the Institute on the 15 August 1958, Bill and Keera Le Lievre, Ron Opie, Harry Sprintz, D.H. Bill, D. Zoureff, Wal Hardacre, Bruce Hyett and J.L. Delbridge became members of the IDIA in October of that year. Jack states in his notes that, ""in later years, more members of the IDAA joined the IDIA which after 1958 became the dominant design organisation in Australia."" In the first year of its establishment, the IDIA gained a membership of some 32 members: 24 from Vic., 3 from NSW, 3 from the ACT and 2 from SA.   <""The Establishment of the Society of Designers for Industry and its Development into the Industrial Design Institute of Australia.""

"A Victorian lighting manufacturer, based in Carlton founded by Donald C. Brown  in equal partnership with David Evans and Ivor Evans under the brand name BECO (1947). Brown bought out the Evans brothers in 1960, later working as BECO Lighting Pty Ltd as the sole Managing Director.Brown Evans & Co was formed as a partnership in 1947, with three equal partners - Donald Christopher Brown, David R Evans and Ivor H Evans. The object was to introduce a range of engineered light fittings with defined lighting properties and architectural appeal, especially in the recessed downlight and modern wall bracket field, using the Brand Name ""BECO"".
Remarkable success followed and the Company manufactured lighting using bullet-shaped reflector brackets on swivel arms, which included wall and ceiling mounted units, and square and recessed downlighting.
The principal business of the company, henceforth, revolved around the designing, developing and manufacturing of standard and special light fittings for the wholesale electrical trade. The company's product being normally sold by direct selling to a wholesaler with agents in every State, but also manufacturing lighting to specification, by Architects Engineers and other Consultants.
BECO Lighting Pty Ltd was incorporated in July 1960 with an authorised capital of 50,000 Pounds, consisting of 10,000 issued shares to each of the three directors, Brown, Evans and Evans. 
In 1960, in addition to the normal flow of lighting products, BECO designed and marketed, through Dunn Air-conditioning Pty Ltd a new series of air registers, door relief grills and other air-conditioning accessories. This grew beyond the manufacturing capacity of BECO Lighting Pty Ltd and in June 1963, a new company was formed, LYCON Pty Ltd for,the sole purpose of manufacturing exclusively, the basic metal ware for BECO Lighting and the full air-conditioning range for Dunn Air Conditioning Pty Ltd. This factory was based at Moorabbin, Melbourne and all BECO machinery used to accommodate this, from their No 1 Factory in Berkeley Street Carlton was moved to a Moorabbin factory. (Address unknown)
BECO Lighting' headquarters remained in Carlton.
They maintained a 2500 sq.ft factory at 127 Berkeley street, named Factory #1, a 3000 sq. ft factory at 122-128 Berkeley street, named Factory #2, offices and showroom at 138-140 Berkley street, and a Design Section and Store, 130-136 Berkeley street.
In July 1963, partner Donald C Brown, acquired the shares of his partners D.R Evans and I.H.Evans becoming sole proprietor and director of Beco Lighting Pty Ltd.

"Embroiderers, were sisters living with other members of the family at Fernbank Farm, Westbury, Tasmania in 1901-3 when they are thought to have embroidered the Westbury Quilt.Embroiderers, were sisters. They were apparently living with other members of the family at Fernbank Farm, Westbury, Tasmania in 1901-3 when they are thought to have embroidered the famous _Westbury Quilt_ n.d. (c.1901-03, cotton 224.5 x 188.8 cm, ill. _Heritage_ section frontispiece). As with so many quilts and other craft items, however, the provenance is unclear. Before being acquired by the NGA in 1990, the quilt had enjoyed a certain local fame displayed over a stand in the dining room of the Fitzpatrick Inn in Westbury, northern Tasmania, a renowned place of pilgrimage for anyone interested in intact interiors and local furniture and crafts. The Misses Fitzpatrick, who owned the inn (and made the legendary sloe gin that appeared on one's account as 'telephone calls' after the inn lost its licence - it had no telephone) were at first unsure of the quilt's origins but later wrote to the NGA that they had purchased it in the mid-1930s from the brother-in-law of the makers, the Misses Hampson, who 'owned a farm over Cluan way'. It shows evidence of being the work of two people, although each square is the work of one individual. One panel wishes 'good luck to the winner of this', suggesting that it was made to be raffled at some charity fete. A variety of scenes from Tasmanian life at the turn of the century are depicted. Family and home, epitomised by two houses, both with women standing at their doorways, constitute its social and emotional focus.
Comprised of pieced red squares thickly decorated with appliqué and embroidery, the quilt is scattered with scenes of daily life, notable events, homilies and mottos. One piece exhorts, 'Don't spoil good tea in the making'; another, 'When a woman throws herself at a man's head she seldom hits the mark'; and another, 'Work is the best antidote to worry'. All the family pets are appliquéd and named. Several times a man is seen on horseback hunting and riding, perhaps the brother-in-law. He seems to have spent some time absent from home and one of the makers has expressed her feelings by working three pigs with the motto, 'One man may lead another to drink but fifty can't keep him from it'. In another square a teapot is proudly embroidered and declared 'A faithful friend'. Queen Victoria, surrounded by a garland of the various floral emblems of her Empire, occupies the central panel of the work and demonstrates the makers' patriotism. This square is dated 1901, which probably marks the start of the project. Around the central panel a myriad of smaller squares are placed in rather random order, each reflecting the quilter's mood and preoccupations at the time. The final dated piece, in the lower left-hand corner, is a poignant conclusion to the work: 'Could everything be done twice everything would be done better. Dec. 28 1903'.
The purchase of this and other quilts was made possible by generous donations to the National Gallery's Australian Textiles Fund from groups of quilters, patchworkers and embroiderers, Textile Industry Australia and numerous individuals, notably Les Hollings, to enable the timely acquisition of significant examples of the history and development of Australian textiles.",Jane and Mary Hampson,1,embroiderers sisters living members family fernbank farm westbury tasmania thought embroidered westbury quilt embroiderers sisters apparently living members family fernbank farm westbury tasmania thought embroidered famous westbury quilt n c cotton x cm ill heritage section frontispiece many quilts craft items however provenance unclear acquired nga quilt enjoyed certain local fame displayed stand dining room fitzpatrick inn westbury northern tasmania renowned place pilgrimage anyone interested intact interiors local furniture crafts misses fitzpatrick owned inn made legendary sloe gin appeared one account telephone calls inn lost licence telephone first unsure quilt origins later wrote nga purchased mid brother law makers misses hampson owned farm cluan way shows evidence work two people although square work one individual one panel wishes good luck winner suggesting made raffled charity fete variety scenes tasmanian life turn century depicted family home epitomised two houses women standing doorways constitute social emotional focus comprised pieced red squares thickly decorated appliqu embroidery quilt scattered scenes daily life notable events homilies mottos one piece exhorts spoil good tea making another woman throws man head seldom hits mark another work best antidote worry family pets appliqu named several times man seen horseback hunting riding perhaps brother law seems spent time absent home one makers expressed feelings working three pigs motto one man may lead another drink fifty keep another square teapot proudly embroidered declared faithful friend queen victoria surrounded garland various floral emblems empire occupies central panel work demonstrates makers patriotism square dated probably marks start project around central panel myriad smaller squares placed rather random order reflecting quilter mood preoccupations time final dated piece lower left hand corner poignant conclusion work could everything done twice everything would done better dec purchase quilts made possible generous donations national gallery australian textiles fund groups quilters patchworkers embroiderers textile industry australia numerous individuals notably les hollings enable timely acquisition significant examples history development australian textiles,embroiderers sisters living members family fernbank farm westbury tasmania thought embroidered westbury quilt embroiderers sisters apparently living members family fernbank farm westbury tasmania thought embroidered famous westbury quilt n c cotton x cm ill heritage section frontispiece many quilts craft items however provenance unclear acquired nga quilt enjoyed certain local fame displayed stand dining room fitzpatrick inn westbury northern tasmania renowned place pilgrimage anyone interested intact interiors local furniture crafts misses fitzpatrick owned inn made legendary sloe gin appeared one account telephone calls inn lost licence telephone first unsure quilt origins later wrote nga purchased mid brother law makers misses hampson owned farm cluan way shows evidence work two people although square work one individual one panel wishes good luck winner suggesting made raffled charity fete variety scenes tasmanian life turn century depicted family home epitomised two houses women standing doorways constitute social emotional focus comprised pieced red squares thickly decorated appliqu embroidery quilt scattered scenes daily life notable events homilies mottos one piece exhorts spoil good tea making another woman throws man head seldom hits mark another work best antidote worry family pets appliqu named several times man seen horseback hunting riding perhaps brother law seems spent time absent home one makers expressed feelings working three pigs motto one man may lead another drink fifty keep another square teapot proudly embroidered declared faithful friend queen victoria surrounded garland various floral emblems empire occupies central panel work demonstrates makers patriotism square dated probably marks start project around central panel myriad smaller squares placed rather random order reflecting quilter mood preoccupations time final dated piece lower left hand corner poignant conclusion work could everything done twice everything would done better dec purchase quilts made possible generous donations national gallery australian textiles fund groups quilters patchworkers embroiderers textile industry australia numerous individuals notably les hollings enable timely acquisition significant examples history development australian textiles,5

"Family members and professional photographers, all three worked in George Street, Sydney, at various times from 1865. One of their more unusual commissions was to photograph the 'rare and extraordinary disease' of elephantiasis in the legs of a blind 15-year-old boy.professional photographers, all worked in George Street, Sydney, at various times from 1865. In October 1865 the _Sydney Morning Herald_ reported that Messrs Moss & Co. of Brickfield Hill had taken two photographs illustrating the 'rare and extraordinary disease' of elephantiasis in the legs of a blind 15-year-old boy. They had been commissioned by the boy's medical adviser, Dr Bell, who ordered the photographs in two sizes and was intending to have copies made to circulate among the medical profession and to send to the _Lancet_ , _Medical Times_ and _Australian Medical Journal_ 'so that woodcuts can be executed to appear in these journals, and also a detailed account of the case'. The photographers were commended for the quality of their work in the newspaper, but the medical journals may have been less impressed. No such photographs can be traced.
Moss & Co., who were at 631 (or 637) George Street from 1865-70, apparently included Moses (listed separately in 1869) and Isaac (listed separately in 1871-75), while Morris Moss was at 487 George Street South about 1866-68, having taken over the premises from *James E. Bray* , probably early in 1866. By 1869 Charles H. Tullett was at this address and Morris Moss was working in the Hunter Valley; he was based at Maitland in the late 1870s and 1880s.
In addition, one H. Moss announced in the _McIvor News_ on 8 December 1858 that he had set up a studio at The Portrait Room next to Smith's bakery in Heathcote, Victoria, where he was offering a likeness in a case for 5s.
