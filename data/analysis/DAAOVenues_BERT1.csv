""The Australian Landscape """"\""The Australian Landscape\"" was a national touring exhibition organised by the Australian Gallery Directors' Council in 1972. The organising gallery was the Art Gallery of South Australia, and the curators were Daniel Thomas (Art Gallery of New South Wales) Ian North (Art Gallery of South Australia) and Frances McCarthy [later Lindsay] (National Gallery of Victoria). Generous funding from the Peter Stuyvesant foundation enabled the curators to travel the country together in order to make considered judgements. \r\nThe exhibition opened at the Art Gallery of South Australia on 3 March 1972, and toured to the Western Australian Art Gallery, National Gallery of Victoria, Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, Australian National Gallery (temporary premises), Art Gallery of New South Wales, Newcastle City Art Gallery, and the Queensland Art Gallery.\r\nThe catalogue introduction claims that the exhibition comprised of 'fifty-five of the best Australian landscapes ever executed'. It was characterised by a breadth of vision, with works from every state \u2013 including regional galleries and private collections.  It is distinguished by having a greater emphasis on colonial works than previous exhibitions, and elevating the reputation of Eugene Von Guerard and John Glover. \r\nThere were only two works by women \u2013 Grace Cossington Smith and Margaret Preston\u2013 and none by any Aboriginal artist.""

It is biassed to define one particular direction in contemporary Australian art,\"" they wrote.\r\nThe Field was held a year after MoMA's  Two Decades of American Painting travelled to Sydney and Melbourne, and both its content and its catalogue were significantly influenced by that exhibition. Its professional production as much as the content of the lively hard edge abstract works encouraged the perception that this was the avant garde in Australia in 1968.\r\nIn 2018, the 50th anniversary of The Field, the National Gallery of Victoria recreated the exhibition at Federation Square.""

""Death""""*Casula Powerhouse Arts Centre presents: DEATH*\r\n\r\nArt about death typically brings to mind a certain kind of theatricality or a sombre tone, a classic still life with a skull and an extinguished candle, however the contemporary artists in this exhibition are talking about death in unexpected ways. Death has touched everyone and its effect is often life changing. It is a subject with many complexities. It is capable of stirring powerful emotions and actions, meanwhile by definition it is a simple scientific fact of life, \u201cthe cessation of all biological functions that sustain a living organism\u201d\r\n\r\nThis exhibition focuses on the ways in which we process and deal with death and mortality; practically, emotionally, physically and psychologically, rather than the moment or meaning of death. Death is an unromantic look at some of the many facets of death including a suicide pact in the suburbs of Perth, subverting a fear of death with faux enlightenment, talking to the dead through white noise and the vestigial in elation to the embodiment of memory, archive and grief.\r\n\r\n*Artists:*\r\nDeclan Apuatimi, England Banggala, Carla Cescon, Ronnie Djanbardi, Simon Gende, Nora Holland, Richard Lewer, Thomas Munkanomi, Tony Pilakui, Samuel 'Marbuk' Poantimului, Patrick Pound, Clementine Puruntatameri, Tracy Puruntatameri, Araya Rasdjarmrearnsook, Helen Shelley, Laurens Tan, Hayley West""","Casula Powerhouse Arts Centre, Casula, NSW",17,shore site festival dreaming st cultural olympiad sydney olympic games milpra indigenous art award also participated exhibition caring country future th annual mil pra aboriginal exhibition art award missing spain solo sorry dropped guts solo homebrand contemporary australian ceramics group exhibition poems iraq group exhibition invisible map ahmad iranian writer nasrin mahoutchi worked together searching liverpool collecting objects create imaginary stories lives local residents curator nicholas tsoutas lives group exhibition fibro australian perspecta group exhibition spaces group exhibition liverpool city art prize group exhibition liverpool city art prize group exhibition blake prize religious art group exhibition loveart loveart exhibition works amanda love collection memento expanded version exhibition first staged project contemporary artspace wollongong death casula powerhouse arts centre presents death r n r nart death typically brings mind certain kind theatricality sombre tone classic still life skull extinguished candle however contemporary artists exhibition talking death unexpected ways death touched everyone effect often life changing subject many complexities capable stirring powerful emotions actions meanwhile definition simple scientific fact life u cthe cessation biological functions sustain living organism u r n r nthis exhibition focuses ways process deal death mortality practically emotionally physically psychologically rather moment meaning death death unromantic look many facets death including suicide pact suburbs perth subverting fear death faux enlightenment talking dead white noise vestigial elation embodiment memory archive grief r n r n artists r ndeclan apuatimi england banggala carla cescon ronnie djanbardi simon gende nora holland richard lewer thomas munkanomi tony pilakui samuel marbuk poantimului patrick pound clementine puruntatameri tracy puruntatameri araya rasdjarmrearnsook helen shelley laurens tan hayley west,shore site festival dreaming st cultural olympiad sydney olympic games milpra indigenous art award also participated exhibition caring country future th annual mil pra aboriginal exhibition art award missing spain solo sorry dropped guts solo homebrand contemporary australian ceramics group exhibition poems iraq group exhibition invisible map ahmad iranian writer nasrin mahoutchi worked together searching liverpool collecting objects create imaginary stories lives local residents curator nicholas tsoutas lives group exhibition fibro australian perspecta group exhibition spaces group exhibition liverpool city art prize group exhibition liverpool city art prize group exhibition blake prize religious art group exhibition loveart loveart exhibition works amanda love collection memento expanded version exhibition first staged project contemporary artspace wollongong death casula powerhouse arts centre presents death r n r nart death typically brings mind certain kind theatricality sombre tone classic still life skull extinguished candle however contemporary artists exhibition talking death unexpected ways death touched everyone effect often life changing subject many complexities capable stirring powerful emotions actions meanwhile definition simple scientific fact life u cthe cessation biological functions sustain living organism u r n r nthis exhibition focuses ways process deal death mortality practically emotionally physically psychologically rather moment meaning death death unromantic look many facets death including suicide pact suburbs perth subverting fear death faux enlightenment talking dead white noise vestigial elation embodiment memory archive grief r n r n artists r ndeclan apuatimi england banggala carla cescon ronnie djanbardi simon gende nora holland richard lewer thomas munkanomi tony pilakui samuel marbuk poantimului patrick pound clementine puruntatameri tracy puruntatameri araya rasdjarmrearnsook helen shelley laurens tan hayley west,1,"Casula Powerhouse Arts Centre, Casula, NSW",Government / Public Museum ,Local Government and/or Regional Gallery,Y,NSW

"""Kedumba Drawing Exhibition""""Since its inception in 1990, the public Kedumba Collection has acquired almost two hundred drawings. These have been sourced from the annual Kedumba Drawing Award, approved gifts from artists and other benefactors, and acquisitions by the Artist Trustees and Director on behalf of the Collection. As a result of this unique approach, the collection is considered by distinguished art authorities to be of outstanding significance and importance.\r\n\r\nThe practice of drawing is essential to many artists because it is the primary means of visual expression, offering a direct and immediate way of responding to experiences and expressing ideas.\r\n\r\nDrawings appeal to a wide audience because there are no secrets to how most drawings are made and it is less mediated than most digitally based or graphic arts. Usually burnt pieces of willow, a simple pencil or watercolour wash are enough. The rest depends on how well the artist integrates the hand, the eye and the mind.\r\n\r\nThe large group of enthusiastic Kedumba supporters joined with celebrations of the 25th Kedumba on the 25th of October. The Director Jeffrey Plummer welcomed 15 of the 24 finalist artists,some of whom had traveled long distances. \r\nThe finalist list of 24 artists were Katka Adams,Danelle Bergstrom,John Bokor,Jane Canefield, Anne Edmonds,Melissa Egan,Julie Harris,Ken Johnson Robbie Harmsworth, Jo Lane,Ryan McGennisken, Robert Malherbe, Graham Marchant,Deborah Marks,Paul Miller,Evan Salmon, Kurt Schranzer,Robert Shepherd,Holly Valance and Anthony White.\r\n\r\nThe judge Ann Cape,spent two days of deliberation before making her final decision on the drawings to be acquired for the public Kedumba Collection of Drawings. Ann spoke of the high standard and explained why she had chosen the drawings and her selections are listed below.She announced that they were in no particular order and that her brief was to enrich and enhance the Kedumba Collection.Ann congratulated all the artists who had provided such an interesting and challenging exhibition.\r\n\r\nThe artists selected for the Kedumba colletion for 2014 were e David Edgar,Deborah Marks Paul Miler, Paul White, Jane Canfield and Julie Harris.""

Her cultural heritage as an Aboriginal Australian of Badimaya descent strongly impacts upon her subject matter. Dowling draws upon a wide range of sources within the traditions of European and Indigenous Australian painting. She combines social realism, Surrealism, sixties Pop Art, and motifs from contemporary Aboriginal painting, in her portraiture. Dowling\u2019s art is influenced by the dot and circle motifs in the Papunya and Yuendumu traditions, the rock art of the Kimberley, and the graphic arts of the Torres Strait. The art of Frida Kahlo also directly influences her work.This exhibition is the first survey of this prominent artist, featuring over sixty works."" ""Dale Hickey: Life in a Box""""Dale Hickey is one of Australia\u2019s most highly regarded painters. His work has influenced generations of Australian artists. This survey comprises thirty-six key works and focuses on the immediate confines of the artist\u2019s studio and the objects within it, synthesizing the flat and the painterly. The majority of selected works are large paintings made after 1982. They present familiar, mundane objects in ever-changing configurations within a shallow stage-like space. This exhibition includes large abstract works from the late 1960s, and a group of Hickey\u2019s small still-life paintings from the 1970s that highlight his lifelong exploration of pictorial space."" ""The Plains: Wimmera and the Imaging of Australian Landscape, Philip Hunter and Sir Sidney Nolan""""This exhibition was prepared for the Melbourne Festival."" ""Wolfgang Sievers: images of the University of Melbourne 1956 - 76""""Wolfgang Sievers (1913\u20132007) was one of the finest architectural and industrial photographers working in Australia in the second half of the twentieth century.\r\n\r\nIn 1995, through the Ian Potter Museum of Art, the University of Melbourne purchased from Wolfgang Sievers 141 photographs with accompanying negatives. The fifty-seven black and white exterior and interior views of buildings in this exhibition were taken between 1956 and 1976, a period of great development at the University of Melbourne\u2019s Parkville campus."" ""Raafat Ishak: Recipes for aversion and strategy. Work in progress #6""""This exhibition is a rare opportunity to consider nearly twenty years in Australian art from the perspective of the artist Raafat Ishak, who began exhibiting in Melbourne in the early 1990s.  Ishak\u2019s involvement in many activities including: artist-run initiatives, collaborations with friends, site-specific projects, small-scale painting, and art that comes off the stretcher onto walls and floor, indicate many of the key characteristics of his generation. In this exhibition, Ishak responds specifically to the architecture of the museum."" ""Vivienne Shark LeWitt: comedies & proverbs""""This exhibition is the first survey of the work of Vivienne Shark LeWitt at an Australian art museum. Shark LeWitt is a mid-career artist who maintains a unique presence in Australian art. She makes intimately scaled paintings and works on paper in a deceptively winsome style, where the size and delicacy of the work belies its emotional and poetic impact. Shark leWitt presents vignettes of emotional vulnerability, many of which speak of the subtle gender politics and power plays of everyday life."" ""The Phantom and the City""""From 1988 to 1990, Tim Jones made a series of works based on an elaborate New Guinean sculpture which was originally used as a house-post for an above-water dwelling in Sentani Lake, West Papua. These little known works on paper from the University of Melbourne Art Collection are shown together for the first time with three related sculptures from the artist's collection. An important inclusion in this exhibition is two Papua New Guinean shields from the Leonhard Adam Collection of International Indigenous Culture. The shields are included to indicate the influence of works from this region in Jones\u2019s art."" ""The Drowned World: Jon Cattapan Works and Collaborations""""The drowned world is a major survey of the work of Melbourne-based artist, Jon Cattapan. The drowned world includes a selection of paintings and works on paper that portray the development of Cattapan\u2019s practice over the last three decades, with particular attention given to his collaborative projects."" ""Ricky Maynard: portrait of a distant land""""This exhibition comprises 60 works by the Tasmanian photographer, Ricky Maynard. Through his practice, Maynard documents, records and rewrites the history of Indigenous Australia by creating an alternative collaborative record of Indigenous Australian people. He positions his work firmly within the tradition of the documentary photographer as social activist, and his subject are always strongly connected to his own life as an Aboriginal person. For Maynard documentary photography is about truth and honesty in the pursuit of social justice. His photography is witness to history, and an exploration of the connection between place, story, and feeling."" ""Tim Johnson: painting ideas""""This major survey exhibition begins with Johnson's activities as a conceptual and performance artist in the early 1970s and co-founder of the Inhibodress artists' collective in Sydney. In addition to performance, documentation, films, and artists' books made in the early 1970s, this section also includes Johnson's paintings and prints that are inspired by Punk music. The main section of _Tim Johnson: painting ideas_ commences with paintings inspired by Johnson's visits to Papunya in the 1980s and his subsequent collaborations with Aboriginal artists including Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri and Michael Jagamarra Nelson, among others."" ""Yvonne Audette: six decades of painting""""Yvonne Audette is a senior Australian artist who is regarded as a key figure in the development of abstract painting by Australian artists. Audette's remarkable career spans six decades, and this exhibition includes more than fifty works from 1950 to the present. Evocative and richly layered, these lyrical, abstract works reflect the artist's response to her immediate as well as imagined environment. Paintings that explore the development of Audette's practice and the full spectrum of her career have been selected, and have mostly been drawn from the artist's collection."" ""Intelligentsia: Louis Kahan's portraits of writers""""This exhibition brings together Louis Kahan\u2019s remarkable portraits of writers for the provocative literary and cultural journal Meanjin from 1955 to 1974. With Kahan\u2019s inspired contributions, Meanjin became, in Geoffrey Blainey\u2019s words, \u2018an illuminating mirror of Australian cultural life\u2019. In his work, Louis Kahan AO (1905 \u2013 2002), depicted the facial idiosyncrasies of his subjects and the physiognomic traits of the thinking, working mind.His lively and seemingly spontaneous portraits of contributors were positioned next to text, bringing the ideas of his subjects to life. Kahan\u2019s portraits contributed to the mythic stature of his subjects and the resonance of their ideas."" ""Ludwig Hirschfeld Mack: Bauhaus Artist and Innovator""""Ludwig Hirschfeld Mack is a key figure in Victoria\u2019s cultural history. A master of the legendary German design school the Bauhaus, Hirschfeld Mack emigrated to Australia in 1941 and taught at Geelong Grammar School.This exhibition investigates the progressive and experimental aspects of Hirschfeld Mack\u2019s practice through a display of over forty artworks and visual tools such as colour charts."" ""Groundwork""""The artists in this exhibition all employ different formal and conceptual techniques to explore tensions between story-telling, representation, and picture-making. The concept of \u2018country\u2019 and its depiction within particular cultural frameworks, guides ideas, stories and forms relating to place."" ""Facing Percy Grainger""""This exhibition plots Percy Grainger's passionate forays into costume design, drawing, painting, linguistics, Nordic folklore, museology, and vegetarianism, in addition to the manuscripts and published editions of his musical compositions and arrangements."" ""George Lambert: Gallipoli and Palestine landscapes""""This exhibition traces Lambert's work as an official war artist on his first journey to Palestine and the Sinai in 1918. It also includes paintings Lambert completed during the Australian Historical Mission to Gallipoli in 1919. \r\n\r\nThe exhibition takes as its main theme Lambert's representation of significant landscapes and how these connect to individual and national memories of war."" ""Strange Spectacle""""The wonderfully wry work of Eric Thake (1904\u20131982) and his perceptive visual and verbal puns in this popular Christmas card series are featured in this exhibition, alongside artists who tackle issues with a political edge, or use wit and satire to convey a subversive message."" ""Pastoral landscapes by Norman Macgeorge""""This exhibition is comprised of a selection of landscape paintings by Norman Macgeorge, which are an excellent representation of his oeuvre. The landscapes are lyrical, contemplative, small to medium sized works that portray life in rural settings, open sunlit skys, and treed fields.""

Her research project, including the study of works held in the Sir Russell and Lady Grimwade Bequest, centred on the corporate and cultural activities of Russell Grimwade and his relationship with the university. Amongst many various interests and entrepreneurial ventures, Russell Grimwade (1879-1955) was renowned for his passion for Australiana and native plants. Campbell's exhibition and performance examined from a metaphorical as well as a literal documentary perspective Grimwade's fascination with the eucalypt. Challenging the seemingly arbitrary nature of scientific interpretation and human understanding, Campbell adopts her own unique tools of measurement and assessment, to create a human laboratory, with herself at the centre of the experiment.\n\nSource: Solo Survey Exhibition Linkage Project, Tasmanian School of Art, UTAS\nhttp://www.art-museum.unimelb.edu.au/art_past_exh.aspx (28/05/04)"" ""The plains: Wimmera and the imaging of Australian landscape: Philip Hunter and Sidney Nolan""""Source: Solo Survey Exhibition Linkage Project, Tasmanian School of Art, UTAS\nNational Library of Australia catalogue\n\nExhibition Catalogue:\nThe plains: Wimmera and the imaging of Australian landscape: Philip Hunter and Sidney Nolan.

Today the seas are well-charted political entities, shipping lanes, sites of industry, and sometimes contested zones.\r\nThe artists in the exhibition are: Narelle Autio, Audrey Greenhalgh, Jeremy Kirwan-Ward, Sine MacPherson, Max Pam,\r\nPolixeni Papapetrou, Patricia Piccinini, Ben Pushman, Paul Uhlmann, and Fred Williams.""
