Harold Abbott,"
Born in Sydney in 1906, Harold Frederick Abbott was a portrait painter and teacher of art by profession. From 1923 he began studying art part time at the Sydney Art School under Julian Ashton and Henry Gibbons. In 1931, after being awarded the NSW Society of Artists Travelling Scholarship, Abbott moved to London where he spent the next two years studying at the Royal Academy, returning to Australia in 1933. Having years of academic training behind him, Abbott became highly accomplished in portraiture and still life studies, as well as genre paintings and in 1940 Abbott won the Sulman Prize for his painting Vaucluse interior . Portraiture was of particular interest to Abbott, and the influence of Old Masters such as Velazquez, Rembrandt, and Goya is evident in the portraits he produced. Of portraits, Abbott wrote in an article in Art in Australia in 1939 “...that welling-up of the unconscious that we call inspiration only appears in a portrait when the artist understands his subject intuitively as well as consciously”. His dedication to depicting his subjects with great honesty and likeness is evident in all of the portraits he produced throughout his career. Characteristics of his style were his simplicity in approach, his awareness of compositional balance, his use of light to create depth and shadow, and his narrative painterly style.
In 1941, Abbott enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force, and in 1943 he was appointed acting lieutenant as a war artist in 2/9 Australian Field Regiment. Abbott spent the next two years serving as an official war artist for Australia, during which time he produced a large body of works documenting scenes and portraits that reflected his experiences and encounters from the Second World War. As a result of his commission, the Australian War Memorial holds 180 of these works in their collection.
Abbott’s skills in genre painting were well suited to his duties as a war artist; he constructed highly balanced scenes with a strong underlying narrative that provided a comprehensive and truthful documentation of Australia’s involvement on the home front, in the Pacific Islands, and in Singapore during the Second World War. On the home front, works such as Main Street , Atherton (AWM collection, ART22293) emphasise the effect that the military presence had on the rural town of Atherton, Queensland – impacting both physically and visually upon the otherwise sedate backdrop. Abbott did not often portray the horrific events of war; rather he focused on those specific elements that formed a part of every soldier’s day to day life. His genre works evoke a sense of calm tranquillity, and provide eyewitness accounts of everyday life at war – ranging from hygiene and recreation, to machinery and repairs, as well as general camp scenes which incorporate the local flora, fauna, and surrounding landscapes. In a marked departure from the relatively calm documentation of daily activities, Abbott produced a highly confronting and dramatic triptych depicting the fall of Singapore and prisoners of war working on the Burma-Thailand railway. In a triptych of suffering ( Defeat, Singapore ; On the Thailand Railway, 1 ; On the Thailand railway [all 1946]) Abbott is no longer concerned with the subtler elements of war and portrays the traumatic and deeply disturbing devastation he witnessed in Singapore. Sombre images of emaciated prisoners of war disintegrating under the weight of hard labour and destruction confront and shock the viewer. Abbott’s natural colour palette is replaced by bold reds and yellows that serve to heighten the dramatic representation of torment and suffering. These works are demonstrative of Abbott’s engagement with emotion and drama – a theme that he again touches upon later in life.
As a war artist Abbott also produced many portraits, each one reflecting his skill in being able to capture an individual with great honesty and likeness. His subjects ranged from high-ranking officials and officers to local natives and Japanese prisoners of war. For all those of whom he made portraits, Abbott endeavoured to collect as much information as possible; he would spend time talking with them and observing their behaviour, consequently producing works of a very sincere and personal nature.
In the 20 years following the war, Abbott did very little painting and exhibiting. He instead applied himself to teaching at the National Art School in Sydney, where he later became the head and State Supervisor of Art. In the late 1960s, when he was in retirement, he resumed painting again – however his style was markedly different. Narrative and figurative works in oils and watercolours gave way to bold abstract compositions in acrylics. Abbott ventured away from much of his academic training towards explorations in form, colour, design, technique, and mood. Starting with the use of bold colours and semi-abstract configurations, his works became increasingly non-figurative, eventually discarding all familiarity in form to develop purely abstract expressions in art. Prior to his death in 1986 in Sydney, Abbott held eight solo exhibitions and his work is held in the collections of the National Gallery of Australia, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, as well as various regional art galleries across Australia.

Thelma Afford,"
costume designer and art teacher, was born at Broken Hill in December 1908, daughter of William James Thomas, an engineer, and Ethel, née Henderson. After attending Broken Hill High School, then boarding at Adelaide Presbyterian Girls’ College, she won a scholarship to the SA School of Arts and Crafts. Thelma, an associate member of the Society of Arts, was one of the first five teachers appointed to introduce art into South Australian high schools, teaching at both the School of Arts and Crafts and Adelaide High School. Thelma was deeply involved with the experimental Ab-Intra Studio Theatre in Adelaide, as both costume designer and performer.
Granted a year’s leave of absence from the Education Department, she spent 1934 in Melbourne studying with George Bell and working for Pierre Fornari. Fornari was costume designer for J.C. Williamson’s big musicals; he also had a salon in Collins Street.
As Fornari couldn’t draw it was my job to put his ideas and designs down on paper, not always an easy task. I did the sketches of the Cyril Ritchards-Madge Elliott production of “Roberta”. I learnt a great deal from him, both in actual designing and also in the appreciation of a necessary high standard of workmanship in the making of costumes.
Thelma also did some costume designing on her own behalf for productions at the Garrick and Tivoli theatres and for Melbourne’s centenary Pageant of Nations at the Town Hall. She returned to Adelaide and to teaching in 1935. The following year she was 'lent by the Education Department’ to design the costumes for the official celebrations of South Australia’s centenary. One of these events was the performance of Colonel Light, the Founder , the prize-winning play by Max Afford, whom Thelma was later to marry.
Thelma was invited to Sydney in 1937 in order to commence work on the 1938 Sydney sesquicentenary celebrations, thereby completing a hat-trick of such commissions: Melbourne (1934), Adelaide (1936) and Sydney (1938). The Sydney celebrations – the most lavish of all -took place on 26 January 1938.
In April 1938, Thelma Thomas married Max Afford at St Michael’s, Vaucluse. Both led busy professional lives in Sydney. Max wrote plays for radio and theatre and, later, screenplays; Thelma designed costumes for the Minerva Theatre (e.g. Maeterlinck’s The Blue Bird 1940), Doris Fitton’s Independent Theatre (e.g. The Insect Play 1941), Ken Hall’s Cinesound Films (e.g. Mr Chedworth Steps Out 1939) and for Charles and Elsa Chauvel ( The Sons of Matthew 1947). As well, she designed period costumes for J.C. Williamson’s, was the resident designer for the Minerva Theatre until 1950, and wrote articles for the daily papers and weekly magazines on fashion and theatrical design. She designed the costumes for the very first live dramatic production on Australian television in 1957. In the 1960s Thelma turned again to teaching, being senior art mistress at Queenwood, a private girls’ school at Mosman, until she retired in 1978.
Thelma Afford’s costume designs are held by the Mortlock Library (SA), the Fryer Library (QU), the National Film and Sound Archive (ACT) and the Mitchell Library (NSW). Some of her designs for the 1938 Sydney sesquicentenary procession were exhibited at the Mitchell Library in 1990.

Vernon Ah Kee,"
Screen-printer, drawer, photographer, video and text-based artist, Vernon Ah Kee was born in Innisfail in far north Queensland in 1967. He is of the Kuku Yalandji, Yidindji and Gugu Yimithirr peoples of the Innisfail, Cairns, and rainforest regions of North Queensland, the Koko Berrin peoples of Kowanyama in the West Cape region of Queensland, and the Waanji peoples of the North-West Queensland region around Mt Isa.Ah Kee’s artistic training began in 1986 when he enrolled in a screen-printing course at Cairns TAFE. After graduating from TAFE Ah Kee was employed as a screen-printer at Gum Tree Corner – a local printmaking firm where Ah Kee printed t-shirts. The closure of this business in 1990 was the driving force behind Ah Kee’s 1991 move to Brisbane where, in 1996, he enrolled in the previously mentioned Bachelor of Visual Arts at Griffith University, completing this degree in 1998. He continued with his academic study and in 2000 graduated from the same university with a Bachelor of Visual Art with Honours – Fine Art. At the time of writing Ah Kee is a candidate in Doctor of Visual Art (DVA) program at Griffith University.In an interview with Bruce McLean for Artlines (2-2007), Ah Kee states, “I’ve always been able to draw. I noticed I had the ability to draw when I was very young.” As a drawer of oversized portraits of family members both past and present, he sees himself as largely self-taught and although having always been a keen drawer, it was not until the final year (1998) in his Bachelor of Visual Arts (Contemporary Indigenous Australian Art) at Queensland College of Art at Griffith University did Ah Kee begin to seriously view himself as “an artist”. Inspired by Gordon Bennett and Richard Bell's use of text in their works, Ah Kee began experimenting with text as an art medium. He investigated various fonts, layouts and approaches to kerning (the process of removing the space between letters), eventually settling on Universal font which is then printed onto vinyl. In the article “Whitefella Normal” for the Summer 2007 edition of Artist Profile, arts writer and curator, Glenn Barkley describes Ah Kee’s text works as creating “an often brutal frisson in the way they confront and impact upon the audience.” Ah Kee’s text works manipulate both the formal qualities and connotations of particular words to subvert the viewer’s habitual understanding of text and language.Ah Kee’s first solo exhibition, “If I was White” in March 1999 was staged at Metro Arts Building in Brisbane and in 2003 he was invited to participate in Queensland Art Gallery’s exhibition “Storyplace, Indigenous Art of Cape York and the Rainforest”. In November 2004 he showed “fantasies of the good”, his first solo exhibition at Bellas Malani’s new Wooloongabba gallery space (his first Bellas solo show, “non people” was in 2002 when the gallery was located in Fortitude Valley). 2004 also provided Ah Kee with another first when he produced his first video work for ArtTV/2004, which was a joint project between SBS and the Australian Centre for the Moving Image (ACMI) and that shown at ACMI in Melbourne that same year. Together with Richard Bell, Ah Kee came up with the idea of creating a Brisbane-based Aboriginal artists co-operative and in 2004 Ah Kee, Bell and Jennifer Herd co-founded ProppaNow and invited Gordon Hookey, Laurie Nilsen, Bianca Beetson, Andrea Fisher and Tony Albert into its membership. In 2006, during the opening weekend of the 5th Asia-Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art at the Gallery of Modern Art in Brisbane, ProppaNow presented the group show, “There goes the neighbourhood” at their studios in Brisbane’s West End. Ah Kee submitted his 2006 series of large charcoal portraits of male relatives for inclusion. In an interview with Daniel Browning for Artlines (2-2007) Ah Kee says that these portraits are “an attempt to revision the Aborigine as a beautiful and worthy subject full of depth and complexity.” Browning, in his article, describes Ah Kee as one of the country’s best contemporary draftsmen.In 2007 Ah Kee participated in “Sunshine State, Smart State” at Campbelltown Arts Centre, a show curated by Djon Mundine that included Richard Bell, Fiona Foley, Thanakupi, Ken Thaiday Snr, Tracey Moffat, Judy Watson, Lindy Lee and William Yang. Ah Kee’s work, including portraits and text work, was also included in “Culture Warriors”, the inaugural National Indigenous Art Triennal held at the National Gallery of Australia in 2007/2008 curated by Brenda Croft. Ah Kee’s profile has now attracted international attention with his 2008 series Gaze, which comprises of 12 charcoal drawn portraits on large scale canvasses, selected for inclusion in “Revolution – Forms That Turn”, the 2008 Biennale of Sydney.

Tony Albert,"
Tony Albert was born in Brisbane in 1981. He is one of the longest serving members of the Brisbane-based artists collective, proppaNOW. His career has focused on the experience of displaced urban Aboriginal people who are alienated by history from their traditional country, language and material culture – that is, the demographic majority of Aboriginal people in Australia. His Campfire – a bar heater, with electrical cord in the Aboriginal colours, is a comedic take on the modern urban Aboriginal experience. The campfire, a gathering place in both traditional and contemporary Aboriginal culture, is still a collective experience where knowledge is shared and exchanged. It is relevant to note that Albert’s father’s country is around Cardwell in north Queensland, the traditional land of the Garimay rainforest people with whom he identifies. His family relationships extend further, to Palm Island off the Queensland city of Townsville. Albert was among the first to graduate with a degree in Contemporary Australian Indigenous Art from the Queensland College of Art (QCA) in 2004. Australian Art Collector magazine has named Albert as one of the country’s most collectable artists several times. Albert toys repetitively with popular culture and the representation of Aboriginal people within it. His most recent work recycles genuine Aboriginalia, including kitsch, mass-produced objects such as plaster heads and black velvet paintings. He alters the context in which these objects are understood – most dramatically in his installation work Headhunter, which was purchased by the Art Gallery of New South Wales in 2007. The point he makes is that Aboriginal people’s bodies, literally and metaphorically, are hunted down and commodified. He has since embarked on a shield-making project with members of his family in Cardwell. He was preselected for the Telstra National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award in 2006 and 2007 and his work was consequently hung in the exhibition at the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory (MAGNT) alongside that of many of his peers, including his acknowledged mentor Richard Bell . In 2007 Albert was the recipient of the $15,000 acquisitive Sunshine Coast Art Prize for his photographic series Gangsta Supastar , in which he acts out the role of 50perCENT, an identifiably Aboriginal hip hop artist/gangsta whose posse includes such imaginary personas as Lil Gin, Murri J Blige and Notorious B.E.L.L.Major group exhibitions include: 'The Visitors’, Penrith Regional Gallery (2007); the 2007 Arc Biennial, QUT Art Museum; 'The Revenge of Genres’, Les Brasseurs in Liege Belgium and Cité International des Arts, Paris (2007); the 23rd and 24th Telstra National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Island Art Award, MAGNT (2006 & 2007) and 'Thresholds of Tolerance’, Australian National University, Canberra in 2007. His work has been collected by the National Museum of Australia, Caloundra Regional Art Gallery, the Art Gallery of New South Wales and Griffith Artworks, Brisbane.

Douglas Annand,"
Born in Toowoomba in 1903, Douglas Annand was a highly accomplished graphic designer, textile designer, muralist and sculptor. Having grown up in Brisbane, where he attended night classes at Brisbane Central Technical College, Annand moved to Sydney in 1930. In Sydney, Annand became highly successful as a freelance designer; his work included the development of corporate images for such well-known Australian companies as Union Oil, Farmer’s and David Jones, as well as designs for The Home magazine and the Australian National Travel Association [see NGA 2001 exhibition catalogue]. His design for the ceiling of the Australian pavilion at the 1937 Paris Exposition, along with his role as art director for the Australian Pavilion at the 1939 New York World’s Fair, gained Annand international recognition and brought Australia to the forefront of international design.
In anticipation of the Second World War, during the late 1930s Annand became involved in a camouflage group formed by zoology Professor William Dakin in response to the severe lack of camouflage and concealment strategies specific to the Australian environment. With members including Frank Hinder, Robert Emerson-Curtis, Sydney Ure Smith , Russel Roberts and Professor Leslie Wilkinson, the group dedicated itself to exploring issues of concealment and developing new techniques for camouflage in Australia, independent of any Government support. At the outbreak of war, the group became the foundation of the Camouflage Committee, which was formed by the Ministry of Home Security. Annand’s background in design, together with his strong interest in nature made him the perfect candidate for the role of a camouflage artist, and from 1941-1944 he was employed by the Royal Australian Air Force as a camouflage officer. During his years of service, Annand produced a large body of works documenting aerial surveillance of coastlines and islands off the Queensland coast. Through his attention to detail and understanding of colour and landscapes Annand provided a significant contribution to Australian camouflage research.
Following the war, Annand went back to his work as a freelance designer, whilst simultaneously expanding his range of skills and knowledge in a variety of new media. He produced textile designs, sculptures, murals, mixed media designs, and later became interested in architectural design and glass structures. Throughout his life, Annand illustrated a perpetual passion for all aspects of art and design, and this did not go unnoticed. Prior to his death in 1976 Annand won the Sulman prize three times, and his posters received prizes in Adelaide and Milan. The Australian War Memorial holds 72 of the studies and watercolours he completed during his work as a camouflage artist.
The Powerhouse Museum collection includes two Douglas Annand design archives, which are a valuable record of the design and architectural activity occurring in Sydney and Australia between the 1930s and 1970s. The first archive consists of material taken from Annand’s studio in Killara after he passed away. It includes ideas, sketches and exhibition catalogues, Annand’s designs for national and international architectural murals, posters and textiles, and objects relating to architectural commissions which Annand undertook during the 1950s and 60s.
The second archive includes material such as catalogues, notebooks, sketches and drawings, photographs, posters and correspondence relating to most of the projects Annand undertook during his career. The collection also includes artworks, sculptures, and textile, metal and glass objects.
The National Gallery of Australia in Canberra also holds a collection of Annand’s art-related material.
Addendum from Eye magazineDouglas Annand (1903-1976) was part of an Australian graphic design tradition concerned more with art and aesthetics than commercialisation. Unlike most of his colleagues, he chose not to work overseas and instead set new standards for Australian designers, creating images that were international in their philosophy, yet typically Australian. He was also a watercolourist, a textile designer, a muralist and a sculptor of originality and style. In 1937 Annand was commissioned to design the brochure and ceiling mural for the Australian Pavilion at the Paris Exposition designed unsuccessfully by architects Stephenson & Turner. In 1939 he was made design director for the Australian Pavilion at the New York World’s Fair, this time supervising Stephenson & Turner. This widely admired design was featured in Australian Art Annual 1939 and the Architectural Review selected it in its Special New York World’s Fair issue. He was rewarded in 1940 with a bronze medal from the Australian Commercial and Industrial Artists’ Association. In 2003, Melbourne’s Heide Museum and Gallery staged a retrospective exhibition of his work.Source—www.eyemagazine.com/feature.php?id=77&fid=439

Michael Anning,"
Ydinji carver and painter Michael Anning, also known as Boiyool, was born in North Queensland in 1955. His work, shields, swords and sculptural carvings are greatly influenced by the traditional styles and media of his people. Carvings and the use of natural pigments and charcoal have been a fascination for him since the age of 13.
Anning’s carvings and sculptures were featured in the “Gatherings and Gatherings II, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art of Queensland Australia” in 2001 and 2006 respectively. In 1998 Anning won the the Wandjuk Marika Memorial 3 Dimensional Award at the Telstra National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards at the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory (MAGNT) with his sculptural piece “Dulgubarra, Rainforest Dwellers”. This work was selected for MAGNT’s 20th anniversary national touring exhibition, “Telstra National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award: Celebrating 20 Years” in 2004 – 2005.
In the catalogue of the first “Gatherings” exhibition Annings states that he hopes to “create a broader view of all rainforest tribal culture to remember my grandparents and other elders who, as children, once lived and roamed beneath the dark green canopy known today as the Wet Tropics.”

Howard Arkley,"
Howard Arkley a painter, photographer and sculptor was born in Melbourne in 1951. A visit to the National Gallery of Victoria’s 1967 'Sidney Nolan Retrospective Exhibition, Paintings from 1937 to 1967’ inspired him to immediately take up painting. Arkley undertook his formal studies at Prahan College of Advanced Education and completed his Diploma of Art and Design in 1975. In this early period he utilised the airbrush as his principal working tool. His first solo exhibition was held at Tolarno Galleries in Melbourne in 1975. This exhibition was titled 'White Paintings’ and it featured Arkley’s abstract and monochrome works.
In 1977, Arkley was the recipient of the Alliance Française Art Fellowship, the Visual Arts Board residency in Paris and the Green Street Studio residency in New York. Whilst abroad, he developed his signature spontaneous and obsessive working style, returning to Australia with a new perspective on Australia’s national context. Arkley began to introduce colour and figuration, focusing on everyday suburban themes and iconography. Beginning with his collection of flyscreens, his work reflected notions of domesticity (feminism), mass production (popular culture), surface (minimalism), pattern, order and reproduction, using and reusing his collected bank of images and iconography. He was heavily involved in the local punk scene and in 1981 admitted its influence in his frenetic work titled Primitive, which, as the artist states, “set off my career” (Arkley in Crawford and Edgar, 2001, p. 48). His work took a new direction. The automatic nature of Primitive reflected his personal life; embedded with his collected and reused iconography it led him toward portraits and his tattooed 'Urban Tribalism’ series.
1983’s Suburban Interior marked Arkley’s entrance to the interior suburban space. The use of wallpaper as a surface for decoration and scenes of 'home life’ reflected his increasing interest in domestic themes and was followed by streetscapes, homes with gardens, high rise apartments and home décor which he saw as popular imagery to address. By 1988, all of Arkley’s work was focused on suburban themes. He made his professional and commercial breakthrough, reconfiguring Australian suburbs as landscapes. He returned to portraits in 1990 with Tolarno Galleries’ 'The Head Show’, which he saw as self portraits “wearing masks and hiding identities” (Trioli, 1990). Arkley also began his collaboration with Juan Davila in Blue Chip Instant Decorator. This successful partnership resulted in the merging of painting, installation and constructed furnishing and further developed Arkley’s style and confidence.
Mix 'n’ Match of 1992 was inspired by home decorating magazines Home Beautiful and Better Homes and Gardens . Arkley reduced his form to stylised images, paying increasing attention to details (pictures on walls, books on shelves). 'The Pointillist Suburb’ series followed in 1994 and he finally felt he had connected with his audience.
Tolarno Galleries’ ’20 Year Review’ (1995) and the 'Fabricated Room’ (1997) series preceded Arkley’s selection as Australia’s representative at the 48th Venice Biennale (1999). 'The Home Show’ had a critical and popular success resulting in offers of exhibitions in Paris and London.
Shortly after his returning to Melbourne from the Biennale Arkley died of a heroin overdose. Since his death Arkley’s work continues to be exhibited and is highly regarded as serious studies of Australian suburban landscape.

Bronwyn Bancroft,"
Bronwyn Bancroft is a Bandjalang artist of the Djanbun clan, born in Tenterfield, NSW in 1958. In 1980 she completed a three year Diploma of Visual Arts at the Canberra School of Arts, and then moved to Sydney where she continues to live with her three children. Subsequent periods of study have included a Masters of Studio Practice and a Masters of Arts in Painting at the University of Sydney in 2003 and 2006 respectively. Bancroft’s creative practice traverses textile design, illustration and now predominantly painting. In 1985 Bancroft established her own company: Designer Aboriginals P/L, through which she produced and sold limited edition hand printed fabrics and garments, and represented the work of other Koori artists. In 1987 her textiles, along with those of Euphemia Bostock and Mini Heath, were showcased by Aboriginal models in a Fashion Parade at the Au Primtemps Department Store in Paris. In 1989 her work was displayed in another European exhibition: 'Australian Fashion: Contemporary Art Exhibition’ in London. Items from these exhibitions are now in the collection of the Powerhouse Museum, Sydney.
Bancroft was a prominent figure within the community of urban-based Indigenous artists who gained a profile within the Australian art world in the 1980s. She was a founding member of Boomalli Aboriginal Artists Cooperative in 1987, and was included in the seminal exhibition 'A Koori Perspective’ which was part of the 1989 Australian Perspecta in Sydney. Bancroft’s work has consistently sought to affirm the diversity and distinctiveness of Indigenous Australian identity, often through overlapping renderings of the topics of family, community solidarity, memory, heritage and country. In the video A Matter of Identity produced in 1994, Bancroft makes a clear statement about the way she approaches her creative practice: 'I felt that I was an innovative and experimental enough artist to pursue and define my own Aboriginal imagery from within myself and my experience as an Aboriginal artist and person as opposed to just copying traditional imagery.’ This approach is reflected in the combination of photomontage and painting in the work You don’t even look Aboriginal (1991), in the collection of the Art Gallery of New South Wales. More recently her work has explored 'her family’s history and a sense of place through the prism of modern science’ and the way social narratives 'are spread through the forces of history and its collision with the natural world.’ (Vivien Anderson gallery website). Bancroft’s work is usually vibrantly coloured, reflecting her intuitive approach to colour. Sinuous figurative and plant forms, or more abstract curvilinear organic shapes and geometric structures are interspersed with intricate patterning. A common theme is the sacredness of nature , often evoked through an imaginative penetration of natural forms such that they are transparent to the viewer, layered and magnified in scale, or rendered so that we can see the continuity of plant forms above and below the ground.
Bancroft held her first solo exhibition at Boomalli in Sydney in 1989, and has held a number of solo exhibitions throughout her career, most recently at Vivien Anderson Gallery (2006) and the Koori Heritage Trust (2005), both in Melbourne. In 1991 a painting by Bancroft was appropriated for clothing produced by the fabric company Dolina. The case was settled out of court, however Bancroft’s struggle to hold the company to account for the forgery was part of a body of artistic copyright cases in the 1980s and 1990s that increased the public recognition of Indigenous cultural property rights, and was commemorated in the 1996 national touring exhibition 'Copyrites: Aboriginal Art in the Age of Reproductive Technologies’. Other significant group exhibitions in which Bancroft has participated include 'Six Contemporary Australian Artists’, Galerie Zuiger, Santa Fe, USA, in 2006; 'Our Place: Indigenous Australia Now’ at the Benaki Museum, Athens 2004; 'Native Title Business – Contemporary Indigenous Art’, toured by the Regional Galleries of Queensland, 2002; 'Urban Focus’, at the National Gallery of Australia, 1994; 'Contemporary Aboriginal Art 1990 from Australia’, Third Eye Centre, Glasgow, Scotland, 1990. Her work is in a range of state, corporate and private collections in Australia and overseas.
Bancroft has illustrated numerous children’s books, including Fat and Juicy Place , authored by Dianna Kidd, which was awarded the Australian Multicultural Children’s Book Award in 1993. Also in that year she provided the illustrations for Stradbroke Dreamtime , by Indigenous poet and activist Oodgeroo Noonuccal (Kath Walker). In 1994 she was selected to be the Australian candidate for the Jack Keats International Award for Excellence in Children’s Book Illustration, and in 2000 was the recipient of the third May Gibbs’ Residential Fellowship at Dromkeen, Victoria. Sun Mother Wakes the World: An Australian Creation Story , authored by Diane Wolkstein and illustrated by Bancroft was included in the New York Public Library’s Top 100 Children’s Books in 2004. Bancroft has also collaborated with Indigenous author and artist Sally Morgan, providing illustrations for the children’s books Just a Little Brown Dog , Dan’s Granpa and In Your Dreams , written by Morgan and published in 1997. The two artists exhibited together in 1991 with a prints show at Warrnambool Art Gallery, Victoria, and most recently at Hogarth Galleries, Sydney with the exhibition 'Honouring Life’. (2007).
Over the period of her career, Bancroft has received numerous commissions from the public and private sector, as well as for non-government organisations such as Amnesty International, to design murals and contribute to other public art enterprises, and provide illustrations for books, brochures, posters and logos. Among her commissions was a theme designing role for the opening of the 'Journey of a nation – Federation parade’ in Sydney in January 2001. Bancroft has been a passionate advocate for Indigenous people and the arts, with sustained periods of association with organisations such as Viscopy, the Council of the National Gallery of Australia, the National Indigenous Advocacy association, and the advisory board to the Museum of Contemporary Art. She also maintains a strong commitment to education, working as a tutor, lecturer and workshop convenor at a number of institutions, and participating as a speaker across a range of academic and community forums. In 1999 she was recognised as an Australian living treasure and in 2003 she was awarded the Centenary Medal of Australia.

Tom Bass,"
Tom Bass AM, DVisArts, public sculptor and teacher, was born in Lithgow, NSW, in 1916. His parents both grew up in rural NSW, his father the son of a baker, and his mother a descendant of early Australian gentry. At the time of Tom’s birth, his father, also a baker by trade, was contributing to the war effort working in an arms factory in Lithgow. In 1919, at age three, Tom moved with his family to the outskirts of Griffith, where his father worked as a baker for the construction workers of the post-war irrigation scheme. From 1920-26 the family relocated several times, moving between work in Erskineville and the rural towns of Parkes and Gundagai, before eventually settling in the working class Sydney suburb of Marrickville in 1927.   During the depression, in 1931 Bass left school to work; he was fifteen years old. Jobs were scarce, however, forcing him to travel the countryside, often on foot, seeking employment. At twenty-two he returned to Sydney, having decided to pursue his desire to study art. He posed as a life model at several art institutions, eventually commencing his art studies at Dattilo Rubbo’s atelier. From 1937-40 Bass learnt drawing skills and basic art principles under Dattilo Rubbo’s guidance, and in 1937 met his first wife, fellow student, Lenore Rays. In 1940, a year after World War II commenced, he was conscripted and sent to duties in Bathurst, then Sydney. Bass and Lenore Rays married during the war and moved to Minto, where they continued to live until 1975.  Following his discharge from National Service, Bass attended The National Art School in Sydney under the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme from 1946-48. During this time he was taught by the Head of the Sculpture School, Lyndon Dadswell. In his final year of art school, he received his first commission from a family of Queensland graziers, seeking a sculptural piece for their country property in Sutton Forest, NSW. After much deliberation over a theme of relevance to the lives of the rural family, Bass created a sandstone fireplace depicting a drover on his horse, titled Jack Earth.  After graduating, Bass worked as an assistant to his previous teacher, Dadswell, from 1949-50, whilst trying to explore and define what type of sculptor he wished to be. Creating sculpture for exhibition in galleries was not his ambition; instead his interest lay in the function of sculpture in society, and how it could be used to represent people and communities (Bass &amp; Harris 1996). It was during this time that Bass developed his philosophy of working with totemic forms and emblems to create works of significance to the people that they serve. To Bass, the totem was defined as 'an object that is so imbued with the meanings and the values of the people for whom it is made, that they can stand around it (the object) and connect with those things without a word being uttered…that to me is a totem, and that is the thing that has really inspired my work’ (Bass 2006).  In 1951 Bass became a member of the newly founded Sculptors’ Society, and during the early 1950s he received media exposure through the Society’s growing public profile (Carson 2006). Bass’s work was featured in many group exhibitions with The Sculptors Society, including its first outdoor exhibition in the Botanic Gardens in 1951. Bass remained a member of The Sculptors Society until 1964, occupying the executive positions of president, treasurer and secretary during this period.   From the early 1950s, Bass’ commitment to representing communities saw him become a sculptor of public art, with commissions from schools, universities, religious institutions, and government and corporate organisations. During a time when public monuments were being replaced by public art, Bass became a highly sought after sculptor of commissioned works. Significant public commissions, including The Student (1953) for the University of Sydney, The Falconer (1953-55) for the University of NSW, and The Trial of Socrates (1954-56) and The Idea of a University (1954-59) – both for the University of Melbourne – are evidence of the support for Bass by the tertiary sector. In 1953, Bass was chosen to represent Australia at the prestigious 'Unknown Political Prisoner International Sculpture Competition’ at the Tate Gallery in London, which led to further professional acknowledgement (Carson 2006). Corporate commissions Research and Herald Sculpture (1956-59) followed, along with religious works External Crucifix, Reredos Crucifix and St Paul the Sailmaker (1955-56) for St Augustine’s Church, Yass.   During the 1960s, Bass produced numerous prominent and highly publicised civic works. The P&amp;O Wall Fountain (1962-63) was controversially featured on the cover of Oz Magazine, the Lintel Sculpture (1967-68) formed the entrance to the National Library of Australia, and Ethos (1959-61) became Canberra’s first piece of public art work (Cloughley 2006), representing the spirit of the community of the national capital. Unlike many artists of the time, Bass chose to work independently of the commercial gallery realm, personally managing his own commissions and projects. As a public sculptor in a period of cultural and societal change in Australia, Bass was a key advocate for the inclusion of sculpture in public spaces. Significant religious commissions were developed during the period, including Our Lady Archetype of the Church (1959-62) for Saint Mary’s Cathedral in Hobart, and the Crucifix (1965-66) for the Chapel at the Royal Military College, Duntroon. Additionally, Bass’s work became internationally recognised through Sculptured Emblem (1968-1969) on the Australian Chancery Building in Washington DC, USA. It was in the 1960s that Bass undertook two study trips abroad, the first to Europe, in 1962, and to the USA in 1969, coinciding with the Washington DC commission. On this latter trip he met Australian expatriate sculptor, Clement Meadmore, and was inspired by the work of David Smith. According to Hoekstra, his “experiences in America helped him to see that he needed to explore his inner world… in sculpture… in the relationships with those near to him and with himself”(pers. comm.). In the 1970s Bass changed direction as an artist, choosing to focus on personal sculptures, and engaging in a new teaching vocation. His two major commissions of this period include Entrance Sculpture (1971) for the University of Technology, Sydney, and The Genii (1973) for the Queen Victoria Gardens in Melbourne, Victoria. After a short stint of teaching life study at the National Art School in 1973, Bass spent six months renovating a studio on Broadway, which then opened as the Tom Bass Sculpture School in 1974. The independent art school was designed to encourage a new generation of Australian sculptors, and promote sculpture in the community.  In 1980 Bass held his first solo exhibition at the David Jones Art Gallery, resulting in mixed reviews. Whilst teaching at the Tom Bass Sculpture Studio School, he completed several commissions including The Arts and the Sciences (1984) for the Great Hall at the University of Sydney, and Christopher Robin (1989) for the Prince of Wales Children’s Hospital. Bass and Lenore had separated in 1975 (and divorced in 1981), and in the early 1980s, Bass met and married his second wife, Margo Hoekstra.  During the 1990s Bass continued his leadership and teaching roles at the Tom Bass Sculpture Studio School, whilst participating in group exhibitions such as 'Sculpture by the Sea’ (1999) in Bondi. In 1998, after much resistance, the Tom Bass Sculpture Studio School was forced to relocate, moving to a new site in Erskineville. In 2003, Tom Bass handed the school over to a management committee, as it became an incorporated, not-for-profit association.   As a public artist, the development of Bass’s career has been well documented by the media. Beginning with articles portraying Bass as an ex-serviceman turned artist in the early 1940s, the literature following his career is extensive. He has received both criticism and praise from the media, yet his choice to work outside the gallery realm saw him receive little attention from the arts community (Bass 2006). Since the 1950s, radio interviews, documentaries and television features have provided the public with first hand glimpses into Bass’s life and career. He has been featured in books such as The Development of Australian Sculpture: 1788-1975 (Sturgeon 1978), Australian Sculptors (Scarlett 1980) and The New McCulloch’s Encyclopaedia of Australian Art (McCulloch 2006). In 1996 he co-authored his biography titled Tom Bass-Totem Maker, and in 2006 a book accompanying his retrospective exhibition was released.   In recognition of his services to sculpture, Bass was made a member of the Order of Australia in 1989. This lead to a resurgence of media interest and public recognition of his contribution to Australian sculpture. Following a career that had spanned sixty years, and to mark his ninetieth birthday, in 2006 the 'Tom Bass Retrospective’ was held at the Sydney Opera House. In 2009 Bass was awarded the degree of Doctor of Visual Arts (honoris causa) by the University of Sydney, in recognition of his excellence as a sculptor and teacher. Thomas Dwyer Bass died on 26 February 2010 and is buried at Macquarie Park Cemetery at North Ryde.

George W. Bell,"
painter and press artist, born in Melbourne, was a 'pioneer member of the new art classes’ at Caulfield Technical School. William Dargie was one of his lecturers. After serving in New Guinea during WWII, Bell remained studying native artefacts. Then he returned to Sydney and attended classes at SORA, a period he describes as full of 'rich, exciting ideas’. He returned to Melbourne and spent nearly 25 years as a press artist with the Herald and Weekly Times , retiring in the mid-1970s. Since then has had a number of exhibitions of his paintings and drawings. His charcoal illustrations on rag paper of 'Alice in Wonderland’ were included in the Carroll Foundation exhibition of 1990. In 1990 he was working on the theme of Eureka, 'Australia’s most celebrated rebellion against colonial rule’.

"
Richard Bell,"
Enfant terrible , bad boy of Aboriginal art , angry Aboriginal artist , these are some of the terms that have been used to describe Richard Bell. Bell, however, describes himself as a propagandist and his art as liberation art; propagandist because his highly coloured synthetic polymer on canvas works speak of Aboriginal oppression, government policies, anthropological research, art market feeding frenzies, Aboriginal art industries and non-Aboriginal Australia’s fascination with 'the exotic other’; liberation art because as Bell states in his artist statement in the 2007 “Culture Warriors” catalogue
“Our art (art of east coast Aboriginal artists from closely settled east coast cities and towns) has been, incorrectly I believe, called 'urban Aboriginal art’. It is work that often speaks of contemporary injustices against our people. Liberation art is a far more accurate term that may also help to discourage the perpetual attempts to ghettoise us” (pg 59).Through his work Bell addresses continuing injustices against Aboriginal people. Bell himself has experienced some of these injustices.
Born in Charleville, Queensland, in 1953 the eldest of two boys, the family moved frequently in search of work, living in Augathella, Morven, Mitchell, Rockhampton, Dalby and Darwin. His father was frequently absent, working as a drover and cane cutter. By the time Bell was 17 he was living in a flat with his brother, Marshall (then 14) when their mother died. The Queensland authorities deemed that the two boys were in danger and threatened to send them to state government homes until they were fostered by Nellie and Harold Leedie in Bowenville, 60 kilometres northwest of Toowoomba in southeast Queensland. Nellie Leedie is a cousin of “Sugar” Ray Robinson the renowned Aboriginal activist from Charleville.Bell dropped out of high school in year twelve and began a toolmaking apprenticeship with Napier Brothers in Dalby. This was organised through the Dalby Waratahs A-Grade Rugby League Football Team who also secured him a tradesman’s (rather than an apprentice’s) wage. He stayed with Napier Brothers for two years and then in 1974 left to go fruit picking in Tasmania and Victoria before finding himself in Redfern, Sydney, later that same year. There he associated with and became part of the political movement. Sport too, was part of his Redfern experience and he played for the Redfern All Blacks Rugby League Team. After ten years of living in Sydney, Bell relocated to Toowoomba and found employment as an Office Manager with the Aboriginal Legal Service for a brief time. He then moved on to live in Moree with his partner, Liz Duncan, and they subsequently had two children, Marshall and Sissy (with his youngest, Sarah to follow in Brisbane in 1996). He already had three other children, Adrian, Richard, and Deborah. In Moree, Bell gained employment at the Pius 10th Aboriginal Corporation, an organisation that ran a pre-school, an adult education centre and a medical clinic. Bell was responsible for expanding the service to include a dental clinic.
After Sissy was born, Bell moved the family to Brisbane where he began working with his brother crafting boomerangs and other artefacts for the Brisbane international tourist market. They sold their work, along with the work of other artists including Robin O’Chin, from their own shop, 'Wiumulli’, in Melbourne Street in Brisbane’s CBD. This shop remained open from 1987 to 1990 but Bell continued making work for the tourism sector in Brisbane until 1994. As well as crafting boomerangs he made postcard style prints that were mounted and shrink-wrapped and distributed throughout Queensland and New South Wales tourist information centres and other tourist retail outlets. Though he was working as a 'tourist artist’ he was also being exhibited in 'fine art’ exhibitions and in 1989 he and Mark Garlett created the work, Rock (art) of Ages , which was acquired by the Queensland Art Gallery and shown in their “Balance 1990” exhibition.From 1998 until 2000, Bell was living the life of an itinerant in Moree, Kempsey and Redfern. During the 2000 Sydney Olympics, whilst in Redfern, Tiriki Onus ( Lin Onus 's son) invited Bell to attend the opening of his late father’s exhibition, “Urban Dingo”, at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney. This was to be the experience that changed the course of Bell’s artistic career. Before the opening, Bell, Onus and Michael Eather met for a discussion about art and politics which in turn led Bell to revisit his previous bodies of work, and in a 2008 interview with the author Bell stated that if he was “embarrassed in any way about his previous works he would return to Redfern and to drinking.” Bell re-read some of his earlier writings and interviews and decided that he wanted “to become as good as he was in the past.”Eather invited Bell back to Brisbane to work at Fireworks Gallery and for the following year Bell worked every day for at least twelve hours a day experimenting with different “looks” that could deliver the messages he wanted. The first series to emerge, Desperately Seeking Emily, was what Bell has described to the author as a “Pollock-like approach” to the work with text in relief underneath the painted surface that requires the audience to stand close to the work, forcing them to view it at all angles to read the “hidden” words. Artbank purchased one of these paintings in 2001. Mind Rover Matter (2001) was the next series but instead of synthetic polymer, ochre was employed as the medium. Here Bell was directly referencing the work of the celebrated Kimberly (WA) artist, Rover Thomas, and having a “dig” at the art world’s consumption of what Bell terms “Ooga Booga Art.”Other series that came out of this year of experimentation include The Rise and Rise of Aboriginal Art – a series of coloured bar graphs with geographic layers that had the appearance of cross-sectioned cities – and Shape Shifters, which showed black abstract shapes with the appearance of weird animals on white canvas.In 2002 Michael Eather offered Bell a place in the exhibition “Discomfort” alongside the works of Michael Nelson Jagamarra, Emily Kngwarreye and Imants Tillers at Fireworks Gallery. Bell was originally offered the space for a solo show but the premise of the show grew to include the other three artists. Bell’s work for this show was more of an installation piece where he pinned Bell’s Theorem (12 pages of text) to the gallery walls. Bell’s Theorem is Bell’s essay of his thoughts of the state of Australia’s marketing, consumption and exploitation of Aboriginal artists.At the same time Bell was reading anything and everything he could find on contemporary art. Reading some of Imants Tillers essays and other writings on Tillers he realised that he could “pull the black-fulla act on Tillers” and reproduced Tillers’ work Untitled (1978), in turn a reproduction of a Hans Heyson work, Summer (1909). Bell photocopied an image of Tillers’ version from a book, enlarged it and scanned it onto canvas – “just like Tillers’ original reproduction”.The next year (2003) with his confidence as painter re-claimed, Bell entered a major work, Scientia E Metaphysica , into the 2003 Telstra National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards at the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory, going on to win this prestigious prize. This national recognition presented Bell to the contemporary art world as an artist who clearly has something to say and says it loudly. The accompanying text for Scientia E Metaphysica was Bell’s Theorem.Bell has been curated into a number of key exhibitions since his 'Telstra’ win including his solo show, “Positivity”, at the Institute of Modern Art in 2006, the National Gallery of Australia’s first Indigenous Art Triennial, “Culture Warriors” in 2007, “Sunshine State – Smart State” at Campbelltown Arts Centre in Western Sydney in 2007, the Art Gallery of New South Wales’ photographic exhibition, “Half Light: Portraits from Black Australia” in 2008 and the 2008 Biennale of Sydney, “Revolutions: Forms that Turn”, showing his work on Cockatoo Island on Sydney Harbour. He has also presented a number of solo exhibitions at Milani Gallery in Brisbane where he is represented. He is a founding member of the ProppaNOW artist collective in Brisbane where he lives. Other members of this group include Vernon Ah Kee, Gordon Hookey, Laurie Nilsen, Jennifer Herd, Bianca Beetson, Tony Albert and Andrea Fisher.
Bell’s works are held in the collections of the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Queensland Art Gallery, the National Gallery of Australia, the National Gallery of Victoria, Museum of Contemporary Art, Perc Tucker Regional Gallery, Gold Coast Regional Gallery, Artbank, Queensland University of Technology and the University of Queensland.

Gordon Bennett,"
Gordon Bennett came to art as a mature adult, graduating in Fine Art at the Queensland College of Art, Brisbane, in 1988. He quickly established himself as an artist equipped both intellectually and aesthetically to address issues relating to the role of language and systems of thought in forging identity.
Much of Bennett’s work is concerned with mapping alternative histories and ideas in post-colonial Australia. He rejects racial labels and stereotypes. In 1995, as an act of personal liberation from preconceptions about his Indigenous heritage, Bennett created an ongoing, pop-art inspired alter ego, John Citizen, whom he says is 'an abstraction of the Australian Mr Average, the Australian Everyman’.
In the late 1990s, Bennett began a 'dialogue’ with the work of the late Jean-Michel Basquiat, a New York artist seen by Bennett as someone outside Australia who shared both a similar western cultural tradition and an obsession with drawing, semiotics and visual language. Bennett’s 'Notes to Basquiat’ culminated in a series of works produced in response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks on New York in 2001. Bennett’s subsequent 'Camouflage’ series (2003) references the war in Iraq and issues of secrecy. His most recent abstract works extend the notion of camouflage, dissolving the appearance of difference.
Since 1989, Bennett has held over 50 solo exhibitions and achieved national and international recognition for his work, with representation in biennales in Sydney, Venice, Kwangju, Shanghai and Cuba, and in major exhibitions of contemporary art in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, Prague (Czech Republic), Italy, Denmark, Canada, South Africa and Japan.
The Art of Gordon Bennett by Ian McLean (including an essay by Gordon Bennett), was published by Craftsman House in 1996. Bennett has received several major awards, including the Moët & Chandon Australian Art Fellowship (1991) and the John McCaughey Memorial Art Prize, National Gallery of Victoria (1997). His work is held in all major public art collections in Australia.


"
Mervyn Bishop,"
Born and raised in Brewarrina in north-west New South Wales, Mervyn Bishop was first introduced to photography by Vic King, a local amateur photographer. Bishop would enthusiastically watch King in his darkroom and it was here in this cold Brewarrina room that Bishop first became hooked on the 'magic’ and mechanics of photographic printing. Bishop’s mother, too, was a keen photographer and was forever taking photographs of the Bishop children. It was an Anglican priest, Brother Richard, who first encouraged Bishop to purchase a camera. So began Bishop’s life in the world of the still image, a life far removed from the town of Brewarrina, a life almost unimaginable for a young Aboriginal boy growing up in the 1950s.Photography lit a fire in the belly of Bishop and nothing would extinguish it, least of all the racial barriers that existed in Australia at that time. Australia was still in the grip of the White Australia Policy, although the dismantling of it had begun in 1949, it was not fully abolished until 1973 by the new Labor government, lead by Prime Minister Gough Whitlam.Whilst at school Bishop received a bursary from the Aborigines Welfare Board and was assisted by a group of sub-editors at the Sydney Morning Herald to “help deserving Aboriginal school students” (Bishop in Moffatt 1991, p.7) to further their study. Bishop began his photographic career in 1963 as a cadet photographer for the Sydney Morning Herald . Working there allowed Bishop access to people and places most photographers of the day could only dream of. He was present at the 1965 Roy Orbison concert in Sydney where he captured Orbison both on stage performing and backstage relaxing. It was at this concert that Bishop shot images of Orbison’s support act, The Rolling Stones, on their first tour of Australia. (The Rolling Stones images were printed and presented for the first time in the 2006 'Access All Areas’exhibition at the City of Sydney Library, Customs House, Circular Quay).In 1968 Bishop shot photographs of Barry Humphries in his dressing room at the Tivoli Theatre before and after dressing up as Edna Everidge. He photographed the Pan-Am jet crash at Sydney airport in 1969 and in 1971 he shot the image he called Life and Death Dash in which a nursing nun was rushing a young boy into the emergency ward of St Margaret’s Hospital in Darlinghurst. It was this photograph that won Bishop the 1971 Australian News Photographer of the Year award. In the 'In Dreams’catalogue Bishop was interviewed by Tracey Moffatt about what happened after winning that award; “it was customary at the Herald “ Bishop stated “that if any photographer won the award they would instantly get promoted, but that wasn’t to be for me. I was quietly told that I wouldn’t be getting promoted; the reasons weren’t exactly spelled out. I knew I hit a barrier in what I had to remind myself was still a white world. Here I was the only Aboriginal press photographer in Sydney and possibly Australia. The Herald had given me a break and for that I was grateful but now I was shown that there were limits.” When Moffatt asks him why he did not protest he answered, “I had to maintain a sense of propriety in the hope that maybe other Aboriginal people would be able to gain employment there as well” (Bishop in Moffatt 1991, p.8).In 1974, after his time at the Herald , Bishop relocated to Canberra with his wife, Liz, and began working for the newly formed Commonwealth Department of Aboriginal Affairs in Canberra where he was employed to document the lives and conditions of Aboriginal Australians during some of the country’s most politically turbulent and active years. Working for this organisation gave Bishop an entrée into Aboriginal Australia that had not been granted to any other photographer at the time. Of course being Aboriginal helped break down any barriers of suspicion his subject may have had about the media, but this privileged access was a double-edged sword as Bishop was, in many cases, charged with the responsibility of guaranteeing that his images would be treated with integrity and respect once they left his hands. During this time Bishop shot the image Prime Minister Gough Whitlam Pours Soil Into Hand of Traditional Land Owner Vincent Lingiari ( NT 1975), which was to become his most recognised photograph and the 'poster-image’ for the Land Rights Movement.Bishop returned for a short stint at the Herald in the 1980s and was also a photography teacher at Tranby Aboriginal College in Glebe and the Eora Centre for the Arts in Chippendale. Bishop credits his Tranby colleague Andrew Dewdney for allowing him to read his images with a new eye, to see them as portraits or artworks rather than press images. In 1991 his exhibition, “In Dreams: Thirty Years of Photography 1960 – 1990”, curated by Tracey Moffatt, opened at the Australian Centre for Photography in Sydney.In 2000 Bishop was employed as a stills photographer on the set of the highly acclaimed movie Rabbit Proof Fence , though this was not his first job as a stills photographer, in 1996 he had worked on the Warwick Thornton directed short film, Payback . In 2000 Bishop was the recipient of the Australia Council for the Arts’ Red Ochre Award, an annual award recognising the lifetime achievements of an individual Aboriginal artist.Fellow photographer William Yang was commissioned by the Sydney Opera House in 2004 to direct a spoken word performance of Bishop that would take the audience on the journey of the life and times of Mervyn Bishop. Titled Flash Black , this performance opened at the Sydney Opera House during the Message Sticks Festival of 2004 and toured nationally including the inaugural Dreaming Festival at Woodford in Queensland in June 2005.In 2006 Bishop was invited by the City of Sydney Council to stage an exhibition at their exhibition space in the City Library at Customs House, Circular Quay. This exhibition, 'Access All Areas’ , was curated by the author and displayed approximately thirty oversized printed photographs selected from Bishop’s 50,000 plus catalogue of images, most of which had never before been publicly displayed. In 2008 Hetti Perkins of the Art Gallery of NSW curated Bishop into the exhibition 'Half Light: Portraits From Black Australia’, where his images sit alongside the work of Destiny Deacon, Vernon Ah Kee, Ricky Maynard, Peter Yanada McKenzie, Brenda L. Croft, Richard Bell, rea, Brook Andrew , Darren Siwes, Christian Bumbarra Thompson, Genevieve Grieves, Dianne Jones, Tony Albert and Michael Riley.The Dubbo Regional Gallery – The Armati Bequest staged a solo exhibition of Bishop’s work that was curated by Adnan Begic of the Western Plains Cultural Centre in late 2008 (continuing through to March 2009) titled 'Mervyn Bishop: Journey of a Photographer’ . His work also featured in 'Sorry… More Than a Word’, an exhibition that was staged at Parliament House in Canberra and commemorated the first anniversary of the Motion of Apology to Australia’s Indigenous Peoples. Bishop’s work is held in the collections of the Art Gallery of New South Wales, The Australian National Maritime Museum and The National Gallery of Australia.

Charles Blackman,"
Charles Blackman was born in the Sydney harborside suburb of Harbord, the third child of  Charles Cervic Blackman, a mechanical engineer, and his wife Marguerite Brown, who always preferred fantasy to reality. His father abandoned the family when the boy was four, leading his mother to work long hours at a waitress at Circular Quay – and when she could not cope the children were placed in Dalwood Homes. In primary school he was (briefly)taught by Rah Fizelle. He left school at 13, after an extended bout mumps which confined him to bed. His mother gave him paints to keep him occupied. In 1942 he was employed by the Sydney Sun, first as a copy boy and later as an art cadet. In about 1947 he enrolled in painting classes under Hayward Veal at the Meldrum School of Art, but did not find this to his taste. However he did enjoy the drawing classes at SORA (Studio of Realist Art)and the Sketch Club in Haymarket.The New Zealand poet, Lois Hunter, introduced him to modern art and he began to read twentieth century European literature. Her edition of Lautréamont’s Les Chants de Maldoror introduced him to the work of Odilon Redon. In 1948 he followed Hunter to Brisbane where he met other modernist artists and poets, including his future wife, Barbara Patterson. In 1951 Blackman and Patterson moved to Melbourne where they married, spending the following years. In 1952 Blackman came to the attention of the art patrons John and Sunday Reed, with whom he later quarrelled, as well as the art critic Alan McCulloch. Accounts of the unsolved murder of Barbara’s childhood friend, Betty Shanks, inspired his first series of schoolgirl paintings. Barbara was slowly going blind, and so he read to her children’s and fantasy literature, which came in turn to influence his own art, especially Alice in Wonderland. In 1959, encouraged by Bernard Smith, he joined with fellow artists to assert the value of the figurative image in the Antipodeans exhibition, and designed the exhibition poster. On seeing his paintings  Sir Kenneth Clark suggested he exhibited in London.The Blackman family arrived in London on 2 February 1961, and soon joined the lively expatriate community of Australians. In 1966, missing the sunshine and the beaches, they returned to Australia, travelling first to Perth, Melbourne, Brisbane but ultimately to Sydney.In June 1978, in part because she was irritated by his constant infidelity, Barbara wrote a formal resignation from their marriage, giving him two weeks notice. Blackman subsequently painted a series of nightmare paintings, based in part on Fuseli’s horse, using the actress Kate Fitzpatrick as his model.A relationship with a 19 year old student, Genevieve de Couvreur, led to his second marriage. He continued to admire Barbara and at his 50th birthday presented her with the large canvas, Fifty Flowers (with a white cat in the corner).He first stayed at Buderim, on the Gold Coast, in 1979 and by 1981 was spending most of his time there, painting on themes of lovers, living in idyllic lush tropical beauty. In 1982 he collaborated with the Sydney Dance Company in Dialogues, Daisy Bates and later Spindrift for the Western Australian Ballet Company. In 1984, after the birth of their second child, Blackman and Genevieve separated.From 1985 he began to base much of his work on the butterflies and vegetation of north Queensland, travelling with the poet Al Alvarez. He also worked closely with the Sydney print workshop, Port Jackson Press.In 1989 he married Victoria Bower, whom he later also divorced. His later exhibitions of recent work were not well received by the critics, who noted their uneven quality and bulk production. However the 1993 retrospective, Charles Blackman: Schoolgirls and Angels at the National Gallery of Victoria, demonstrated the full range of his poetic vision.In his last years Blackman suffered from dementia and his affairs were managed by the Charles Blackman Trust, established by his accountant Tom Lowenstein. He died a week after his 90th birthday.

Euphemia Bostock,"
Bundjalung-Munajali woman Euphemia Bostock was born at Tweed Heads, NSW, in 1936. She has worked across a variety of media including textile, sculpture and printmaking since the 1960s. Her artistic training took place at the East Sydney Technical College, Sydney College of the Arts, and Redfern’s Eora Centre.
Bostock was a founding co-member of Boomalli Aboriginal Artist’s Cooperative in 1987, for which she designed the Boomalli logo. In that same year her clothing designs were showcased in Paris, along with the work of Bronwyn Bancroft and Mini Heath, at the Au Printemps Department Store exhibition 'Australis down under’. Other exhibitions include the Museum of Sydney’s 'Bamaradbanga (to make open)’ in 1999, and 'Tactility – two centuries of Indigenous textiles and fibre’ at the National Gallery of Australia (NGA) in 2003. Bostock’s most recognisable work is the 'Possom Skin Design’ screen print she produced in 1990. According to the online catalogue of the NGA’s 'Tactility’ exhibition, this design was informed by the artist’s experience of seeing an incised possum skin cloak from the 19th Century, displayed in the Museum of Victoria in Melbourne. Compelled by the realisation that Aboriginal cultural material from the South-East of Australia was rarely displayed in public collections, the cloak inspired her to create a modern interpretation. In 1999 a section of the design was reproduced on an Australia Post Stam
'Possom Skin Design’ fabric is in the collections of the NGA and the Powerhouse Museum, Sydney and Bostock is also represented in the National Museum of Australia. In 2001 she produced a collaborative Reconciliation Sculpture with artist Jan Shaw for Macquarie University’s Sculpture Garden. Bostock shares a creative and activist spirit with other members of her family. Her brother Lester is a highly regarded and pioneering Indigenous television, film and radio producer. Euphemia, Lester and their brother Gerald were founding members of Sydney’s Aboriginal Black Theatre in 1972, and Bostock was also present for the early days of the Tent Embassy in Canberra. Bronwyn Bancroft , writing in the Oxford Companion to Aboriginal Art and Culture , writes: 'Euphemia Bostock epitomises all that is special about Aboriginal life – she is the matriarch of an extended family, active in political life, working in many levels of artistic practice, and a mentor for her people.’

Robin (Gerard Penleigh) Boyd,"
Robin Boyd (1919-71), Melbourne architect who wrote various influential books promoting the International Modern movement; including The Australian Ugliness, (1960) The Puzzle of Architecture (1965) and Australia’s Home (1952). Although Boyd only built one house in Sydney, his books and articles were familiar to all Australians interested in architecture. As a student, he edited the architectural magazines Smudges and Lines; between 1947 and 1956, he wrote weekly articles on architecture and design for The Age. From 1947-53 he was the first director of the Royal Victorian Institute of Architects’ Small Homes Service, which conducted a regular newspaper column offering house plans. In 1953, he established a partnership with Roy Grounds and Frederick Romberg, and produced several innovative residential buildings. But he did not receive commissions to build major works and the practice was dissolved in 1962. Before that, in 1956-7, he was a visiting professor with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and later emerged as a noted international architecture critic, writing two books on Japanese architecture and numerous articles for international professional journals. In 1965, he was gazetted as a trustee of the National Gallery of Victoria. In 1969, he was awarded the RAIA Gold Medal, and life fellowship the following year. He was made president of the Victorian chapter of the RAIA in 1970, after long service as a councillor. He was a part-time lecturer at the University of Melbourne for several years and a regular broadcaster on radio and television. He died unexpectedly at age 52. Source—Serle, Geoffrey. 1995.

Arthur Boyd,"
Arthur Boyd was born at Murrumbeena, Victoria, on 24 July 1920, the son of the potter, sculptor and painter, Merric Boyd . He attended night classes at the National Gallery School, Melbourne, in 1935, and from 1936 to 1939 painted with his grandfather, Arthur Merric Boyd, with whom he lived in his cottage at Rosebud on the Mornington Peninsula.
Boyd was conscripted following the outbreak of the Second World War and served in the Army Survey Corps from 1941 to 1944. After the war he established the Arthur Merric Boyd Pottery Workshop at Murrumbeena, with John Perceval and Peter Herbst. He turned for inspiration to the Bible, as a means of expressing something of the horror of the war. During the 1950s he painted poetic views of the luminous Wimmera landscape. In 1957 he began his Half-Caste Bride series of paintings, raising contentious issues about the assimilation of mixed-blood Aboriginals.
Following his father’s death in 1959 Boyd moved to England, to Sussex where he mostly lived. But his imagery remained tied to his Australian background, conveying an inner emotional vision rather than describing the external world; telling stories which symbolise human passions such as love, wickedness and aggression, often located within bush settings. He returned to Australia in 1971 and later bought a property at Bundanon on the Shoalhaven River, in southern New South Wales, where he painted many of his later landscapes. Arthur Boyd gave a large collection of approximately 200 paintings, 1000 drawings and about 800 prints as well as sculptures, ceramics and tapestries to the National Gallery of Australia in 1975. In 1993 the Boyd family gifted to Australia his studio and 405 hectares of property at Bundanon.
Arthur Boyd died on 24 April 1999 in Melbourne.

Guy Boyd,"
Sculptor and designer of ceramics, Guy Boyd was the third child of the studio potter Merric Boyd and his wife Doris Gough, and was born at Murrumbeena, where his parents established their studio pottery. His career developed in the shadow of that of his siblings, especially his brother Arthur. After serving in the army during World War II, he studied sculpture with Lyndon Dadswell at East Sydney Technical College. His initial career direction was as a designer and manufacturer of commercial pottery. However in 1965 he changed direction and began to make sculptures, usually based on the human form. The tactile sensual quality of his bronze pieces made them especially popular, although critics tended to regard his work as old fashioned.He was successful in being commisioned to make large sculptures for Tullamarine and Sydney international airports.He also became a passionate campaigner for conservationist causes and the preservation of historic buildings in his neighbourhood.His mother’s devout Christian Scientist faith led him to understand the way in which cultural minorities are easily misunderstood. As a result of this he was an early and passionate advocate for justice for Lindy and Michael Chamberlain after they were falsely accused and convicted of killing their daughter Azaria.


"
John Brack,"
John Brack was a painter and printmaker.
Cecil John Brack was born in Melbourne on 10 May 1920. He attended evening classes at the National Gallery School, studying under Charles Wheeler, from 1938 to 1940, and used the State Library of Victoria reading room after class.  Brack enlisted in the army in 1940, being assigned to the Artillery Corps and stationed in Western Australia.  He was commissioned in 1943 and appointed to heavy artillery, becoming an instructor and later assigned to a field artillery unit bound for Bougainville, Papua New Guinea, however the war ended before his unit was deployed.  Discharged from the army in 1946, Brack returned to the National Gallery School as a full-time student under the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme, studying under William Dargie.  From 1947-48 he shared a studio with Fred Williams, a friend and fellow Gallery School student, in the Salisbury Building on the corner of Queen and Bourke Streets, Melbourne.  In 1948 he married fellow student, Helen Maudsley.  Brack completed his studies in 1949 and apart from a small number of works, destroyed almost all of his student drawings and paintings.  He worked as assistant frame-maker at the National Gallery of Victoria from 1949 to 1951, and then served as Art Master of Melbourne Grammar School until 1962.  He was then appointed Head of the National Gallery School, a position he held until 1968.  
In 1952 the National Gallery of Victoria purchased The barber’s shop 1952 from a group exhibition at the Peter Bray Gallery in Melbourne, the first work by Brack to enter a public collection.  His first solo exhibition was held at the Peter Bray Gallery in 1953 and in 1959 he participated in The Antipodean Exhibition. In 1965 he was awarded the inaugural Gallaher Portrait Prize for Portrait of Harold Hattam 1965 and received a commission from the American Harold E. Mertz, who was establishing a collection of Australian painting.  He was awarded the Travelodge Art Prize in 1971 for Three pairs 1971.  His first major retrospective, John Brack: selected paintings 1947–1977 was held in 1977 at the RMIT Gallery, Melbourne. This was followed by the expanded John Brack paintings and drawings 1947–1977: retrospective exhibition at the Australian National University, Canberra, later in the year.  A major survey of his drawings, John Brack Drawings 1945-79, was mounted at Monash University Exhibition Gallery, Melbourne in 1981.  The National Gallery of Victoria has mounted two retrospectives of Brack’s oeuvre, John Brack: a retrospective exhibition, curated by Robert Lindsay in 1987, and John Brack, curated by Kirsty Grant, in 2009 – both were accompanied by major catalogues.  Other important publications include, John Brack by Ronald Millar, 1971 and The art of John Brack by Sasha Grishin, 1990.  John Brack stopped painting in 1994 and died in Melbourne on 11 February, 1999.

Robert Campbell,"
Robert Campbell Jr (1944-93), Ngaku painter and printmaker was born at Kempsey on the mid north coast of New South Wales and grew up in close contact with the bush and coastline. He first learnt to draw while still at primary school on Burnt Bridge Mission by producing images of birds and animals in pencil on his father’s carved boomerangs. His father would then trace over the young Robert’s design with a red-hot wire, to burn it into the local wood (local wattle and mangrove). As an adult, while toiling at various labouring jobs in Sydney and in seasonal work around Kempsey, Campbell continued to paint for tourists and local art shows, using whatever discarded materials he could lay his hands on.Despite having neither traditional Aboriginal tutoring nor Western art-school training, he worked confidently to invent his own idiosyncratic visual devices and painting style, such as the 'x-ray’ view of the esophagus of his figures. In this respect he differed from the artists of the more urbanised Aboriginal art movements of the late 1970s, which were centred around a population of young Indigenous art students in Sydney. Rather, his patternings resemble designs on the insides of the traditional possum-skin cloaks of south-eastern Australia.Campbell’s subject matter ranged from the brutal history of racism and colonialism in Australia to the mundane existence that constituted life in post-war rural New South Wales. Bright and cartoon-like, his episodic snapshots of contemporary events merge his Aboriginal world view with that of the wider Australian society (from which he was mostly excluded) in an often humorous but always insightful way. He is remembered for his wit and for his celebration of Aboriginal political events, which he saw as points of historical convergence with the outside 'white’ Australian world.In 1987 Campbell and fellow local artists Milton Budge , David Fernando, Mary Duroux, Raymond Paul Button and Sharon Elaine Smith formed the 'Kempsey Koori Artists’ and began working together as an artists’ collective. Campbell had a number of solo exhibitions in private galleries, and his work was included in numerous group exhibitions, significant among them being 'Aboriginal/Australian Views in Print and Poster’, Print Council Gallery, Melbourne, 1987; 'A Koori Perspective’, Artspace, 1989; 'The Continuing Tradition’, National Gallery of Australia, 1989; 'L’ete Australien’, Montpellier, 1990; 'Tagari Lia: My Family’, Glasgow, Swansea and Manchester, UK, 1990; and 'Tyerabarrbowaryaou: I Shall Never Become a White Man’, Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney, 1992. He had numerous solo exhibitions from 1987 – 1997 at Roslyn Oxley9 Gallery in Sydney. He has exhibited internationally at the Rebecca Hossack Gallery, London and Harvard University, USA.He has a following in his community: in 1995 the local Kempsey school held a pageant titled 'Living the Dreaming’ that featured large Robert Campbell Jr puppets in celebration of his work. Examples of his work are held in the National Gallery of Australia (ACT) and Museum of Contemporary Art (NSW), Artbank Collection (NSW), Campbelltown Arts Centre (NSW), Art Gallery of New South Wales, Queensland Art Gallery.

Barbara Campbell,"
Performance artist, was born and raised in Queensland then lived in Sydney until she married the sculptor and installation artist Neil Roberts in the late 1990s and moved to Queanbeyan. (He died early 2002). Her Cloche (1999) – seen only as a video, the medium by which her performances are recorded – shows her chopping off her hair in order to remove a flapper-style close-fitting cap glued to her head (see JK 'Wombat Manifesto’ lecture, published in Republics of Ideas ed. Brad Buckley and John Conomos).
In 199(7?) Campbell did a memorable performance at Old Parliamen House, Canberra that used research carried out for her Sydney College of the Arts MA on images of Truganini (kissing a plate while smothered in thick red lipstick to bring up the signature of the white maker of a Truganini image to the sounds and sights of a session of Federal Parliament on TV in the background.)
In November 1999 Campbell did Inflorescent as the final performance for her residency program at the University of Sydney’s Centre for Performance Studies – a 'part-cycad, part-homosapien specimen’ visible for an hour. Her body was inscribed with cycad-frond patterns and other decorative motifs using special ink that showed up only under ultra-violet light concealed within a woven palm-leaf fan she swept across her body. Initially a counter-point to the Macleay Museum exhibition Adorned , she repeated it in the small room at Canberra Contemporary Artspace’s Gorman House on 14-15 April 2000. Viewed only through the external window of the Gorman House small cube room (shades of Duchamp’s Etant Donnés at Philadelphia), she lay naked in the dark on a chaise longue (shades of Manet and Titian) slowly fanning herself to reveal the tattoo-like inscriptions on her body.
She organised two performances as part of 'LIKENESS: Portraiture and Biography symposium’ at 5.30 pm. on Saturday, 5 May 2001 at Sydney University’s College of the Arts, Balmain Rd, Rozelle: 'SECATEUR, A life of pruning; pruning a life. Vera Violet Isabel Campbell performs the art of flower arranging’ and at 6.00pm 'REMANENCE: Hugh McKenzie Campbell demonstrates the act of water-dowsing’ (the latter performance was cancelled because of rain). Both drew from video recordings of the artist’s paternal grandparents gathered over a six-year period to April 2001 (between Hugh’s 101st birthday and Vera’s 99th). REMANENCE was developed and premiered at the Department of Performance Studies, Sydney University in May 2000. SECATEUR was developed at Sydney College of the Arts in April 2001. The LIKENESS symposium was jointly presented by the National Portrait Gallery, SU’s Research Institute for Humanities and Social Sciences and SU College of the Arts.
In 2001 Campbell’s clever and caustic art-historical performance about international modern art and its teaching in Australia, specifically Sydney University, titled The Machine, Oiled Again , was held under the stair bridge to the Power Department of Fine Arts (see JK article 2002). The five performances connected with SU (including Sydney College of the Arts) were to be recreated in a retrospective in May 2002 with a catalogue/book funded with SU sesqui-centenary funds, but the event was postponed until the end of the year after Neil’s death.

Irene Carter,"
 Painter, musician and teacher who was born in Melbourne, Victoria. She worked as a commercial artist and later had further training in Italy where she also exhibited. Carter returned to Australia and exhibited in New South Wales, Melbourne and Perth being included in the 'Exhibition of Western Australian Painting from 1826-1937’ held at Art Gallery of Western Australia in 1937. Her 1939 exhibit with the Perth Society of Artists was described by the critic Charles Hamilton as, “Irene Carter’s sparkling Grand Canal is a very large water-colour, containing strong lighting and clear atmosphere, and some very sound drawing.” After World War II Carter returned to Italy where she studied watercolour painting. On her return to Perth she exhibited with the Perth Society of Artists in 1952 and the Western Australian Women’s Society of Fine Arts and Crafts. Carter was President of the latter organization in 1952-53. Quite a number of her subjects were Perth buildings though she did paint the Houses of Parliament in Westminster during her overseas sojourn and exhibited that painting in 1952 with the Perth Society of Artists. She won the watercolour section of the Art Competition in 1951. Carter died in 1954.    


"
Karen Casey,"
Karen Casey, Tasmanian Aboriginal artist, was born in 1956 in Hobart. She spent most of her childhood years in Dover in south-east Tasmania, and spent her teenage and early adult years in Hobart. In 1977 she trained at the School of Art, Tasmanian College of Advanced Education in Hobart, and went on to work as a silversmith, jewellery designer and graphic artist. Casey established her artistic career following her move to Melbourne in 1986. 'Aboriginal Australian Views in Print and Poster’, which was toured by the Print Council of Australia between 1987-1988, and 'A Koori Perspective’, which was hosted by Artspace during the 1989 'Australian Perspecta’ in Sydney, were among her first exhibitions, and in 1989 she received a Professional Development Grant from the Aboriginal Arts Board of the Australia Council for the Arts.
Over the course of her career Casey’s art practice has traversed a range of media. Her paintings from the 1990s were expressive figurative works which emerged from an emotive and intuitive approach to the form. These early works often employed symbolism and contained an overt political critique, addressing racial and sexual politics and the tensions that exist between the urban and natural environment. Later works were inspired by childhood memories of Tasmania and a spiritual sense of attachment to certain places. Her ideas began to find more metaphorical and conceptual manifestations in mixed media works; installations that encompassed sculptural, aural and lighting elements; and video, new media and digital photographic works.
Casey only discovered that she had Aboriginal heritage on her father’s side when she was thirteen, and on her mother’s side when she was an adult. Her experience of becoming conscious of this heritage when the prevailing view was that Tasmanian Aboriginal communities were extinct was highly formative of her art practice, both with respect to her emotive and subjective artistic preoccupations and her interest in more cerebral matters of perception and belief. Her works of the 2000s explore scientific and psychological themes relating to DNA, the mind and consciousness.
Casey has exhibited widely throughout Australia and overseas, participated in many community arts projects, and completed a number of public art commissions. Her work is held in the collections of all Australian state galleries, as well as a number of regional and university collections. Her work is also held in collections outside Australia. In 2005 she completed a Master of Fine Art (Public Art) at RMIT University in Melbourne.


"
Craig Charles,"
Craig Charles is a Melbourne-based painter with Yorta Yorta heritage on his father’s side, and Mhutti Mhutti heritage on his mother’s side. Born in 1975 in Mildura, in Latje Latje country, Charles was raised by his great grandparents, Betty Charles, a descendant of the Djara people, and Ron Murray, a descendant of the Wamba Wamba/Lake Boga people. Creativity was part of his life from an early age: the artist remembers listening to stories and drawing with Betty and his siblings at the kitchen table from the age of four. His formal training in art began in 1996, first at the Sunraysia TAFE in Mildura, and then at the Mildura Campus of La Trobe University, where Charles completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1998. As Charles has written in his masters thesis exegesis, a turning point came when an art lecturer “told me about my ability to raise awareness of the 'Koori’ plight, through art” (Charles, 2006:12). Since then Charles’ art practice has been concerned with celebrating Aboriginal people’s resilience, paying tribute to family, ancestors and country, and sharing experiences and stories with wider society. Having lost a number of family members and friends from the Victorian Koori community over the years, creativity of all forms has become a means to draw strength and to heal: the artist describes it as “an amazing form of medicine” (Charles, 2006:8). In 2006 Charles completed a Masters of Fine Arts at RMIT University in Melbourne, during which he pursued these themes and developed technical approaches to articulating them in his work. He has come to draw on a range of artist and natural materials in his paintings for symbolic purposes. For example, gold leaf is frequently employed, as it signifies his respect for his elders and traditional owners. Gold leaf also allows Charles to glorify the country he depicts, such as the Murray River that runs through Latje Latje country, with which he identifies very strongly. The artist has also rubbed his canvases in the earth “to appreciate the physical connection between the image and the land” (Charles, 2006:17), and he uses shellac and oil to bind the dust and grains to the work. Other natural materials such as ochres and charcoal also add texture to his paintings. Charles’ works are recognisable for their dramatic figurative and animal forms and their layered, scraped and glossy surfaces. They are often characterised by a well-defined figure/ground relationship, in which negative space forms a bold, semi-abstract component. In a number of works, Bett’s kitchen tablecloth, symbolised by printed decorative patterning, provides a subtle background. Charles began exhibiting in significant group exhibitions from the mid-1990s, including the National Gallery of Victoria’s “Big Shots Exhibition – We-Iri-We-Homeborn” (1996), the “Art of Place” National Indigenous Heritage Awards exhibitions at Canberra’s Old Parliament House in 1996, 1998 (where he was highly commended in the Emerging Artist section) and 2000, and the touring exhibition “Native Title Business: Contemporary Aboriginal Art” (2002).  In 2000 he held his first solo exhibition “Nana Bett and Me” at Melbourne’s Alcaston Gallery and that same year Charles also established his own dance group, The Black Crow Dancers, which toured Singapore, Hong Kong and Sri Lanka. As a young child he was a member of the Latje-Latje Dance Group in Mildura, and alongside painting, dance remains a crucial creative outlet for the artist. Since 2000, Charles has held several solo exhibitions, including “City style, Country Youth” at the Bunjilaka Aboriginal Cultural Centre at the Melbourne Museum in Carlton (2005), “Mungo Stories” at Australia Dreaming Art, Melbourne (2006), and most recently, “Elders Place”, at the Prahran Town Hall in Melbourne in 2007. The 'Elders Place’ series pays homage to his great-grandparents, Betty and Ron. The works exemplify the artist’s treatment of painting as an expression of, and extension of, family togetherness and sharing, honouring the spirit of his formative experiences drawing at the kitchen table. The work Nan and Pop’s Campfire Kitchen – Pumpkin Stew from this series is in the collection of the National Gallery of Victoria, having won the NGV Acquisitive Prize at the Victorian Indigenous Art Awards, 2007. In 2008 Charles was a finalist for the Telstra National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award. Charles’ work is also in the collection of the La Trobe University (as a result of having won the 1997 Colin Barrie Acquisition Scholarship), the Koorie Heritage Trust, and Museum Victoria.


"
Dadang Christanto,"
Dadang Christanto is a leading Indonesian artist who was living in Darwin in 2006. He was a lecturer at the School of Art and Design, Northern Territory University (1999-2003), completing a residency at the Canberra School of Art before moving to Sydney to lecture at the College of Fine Arts, University of New South Wales (2004).
Dadang has shown widely in major international biennales and exhibitions, including the Biennale of Venice (2003); Yogyakarta Biennial and CP Open Biennial, Jakarta, Indonesia (both 2003); Kwangju Biennale, South Korea (2000); The First and Third Asia-Pacific Triennials of Contemporary Art, Brisbane (1993, 1999); Kanazu Forest of Creation, Fukui, Japan (1999); and the Bienal de São Paulo, Brazil (1998). In 1997, he was a recipient of the Pollock-Krasner Foundation Grant.
Dadang’s professional creative life remains firmly rooted in – and yet resolutely transcends – his home experience and locality, to encompass the deepest levels of human experience. The series of heads exhibited in 'austral-asia zero three’ (Sherman Galleries, 2003) and shown previously at the Alliance Française Gallery in Yogyakarta, refer to the relentless cruelty of humankind among those of different faiths or political systems. The disappearance of multitudes of Indonesian political dissidents during the mid-1960s purges, when Dadang’s father was lost without trace, is a recurring theme in the artist’s oeuvre.
Performance, installation, sculpture, video, painting and works on paper cover the range of Dadang’s art. His installations include They Give Evidence (1996-97); Cannibalism: The Memory of Jakarta – Solo 13, 14, 15 May 1998 (1998); and Red Rain (2000), all highly poeticised reminders of past horrors and present dangers. In 2004, his permanent artwork, Heads from the North , was installed in Marsh Pond, Sculpture Garden, National Gallery of Australia, Canberra. They Give Evidence , the 2003 inaugural exhibition at the contemporary Asian Gallery, Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney, was re-presented for exhibition there in February 2005.

Bindi Cole,"
Bindi Cole, Wathaurung artist and photographer, was born in 1975 in Melbourne. An only child, she was raised by her mother, Vicki Reynolds, in the Melbourne suburb of St Kilda, close to Luna Park. Cole’s mother and maternal grandmother also grew up in St Kilda, and the suburb and its community have often been a source of inspiration for her work. Cole became aware of her Aboriginal heritage in her youth, during a period of time when she couldn’t live with her mother and stayed with her paternal grandmother: “I learnt that I was Aboriginal, that my nan had been part of the Stolen Generations and that we belonged to a mob called Wathaurung” (Next Wave Festival website, Cole 2008). Cole left school when she was sixteen, the same year that her mother died. She spent her early adulthood working in a range of jobs and travelling before deciding, at the age of twenty-six, to pursue her long-standing love of photography. As a child Cole had been fascinated by the photographic practice of a neighbour, Mary, who lived in the same block of flats in St Kilda. Mary sometimes took photos of Vicki, who was a dancer, and had set up a darkroom in a small shed behind the flat complex to develop her photographs. It wasn’t long before Cole began to take and develop her own photographs: “When I was a teenager and old enough to own my own camera, my mum bought me one, as well as developing tanks, chemicals, a black out bag and the other items required for me to develop films at home. I took photographs of my friends and my environment, then sat in my bedroom and processed my first rolls of black and white film” (Next Wave Festival website, Cole 2008).Having made the decision to return to photography in her 20s, Cole worked to further her understanding of darkroom printing techniques under the guidance of Melbourne-based photographer Ponch Hawkes. In 2002, Hawkes helped Cole to put together a folio of photographic works to gain entrance to the North Melbourne Institute of TAFE, and in 2004 she completed a Diploma in Applied Photography. In 2005 she collaborated with Elizabeth Clancy and Kylie-Rose Douglas to create the exhibition 'Same Place, Different Face’, which encompassed a film and photographic series that share the same title. The exhibition documented the changing character of St Kilda, and was displayed during the St Kilda festival of that year. In 2007 she staged her first solo exhibition, 'Heart Strong’, at the Koorie Heritage Trust in Melbourne. A portrait of her father, Bryon Powell, which was part of this exhibition, was shortlisted for the 2007 William and Winifred Bowness Photography Prize. Cole has developed an eclectic methodology encompassing painting, collage, text, weaving, film, performance, soundscapes and projections. She enjoys bringing a range of media together, and tries to include a substantial hand-worked element in all her works (Cole &amp; Browning 2009). Besides Hawkes, she has been influenced by the practice of Sue Ford and Brook Andrew. For Cole, the depth of Ford’s career as a female artist photographer has been a source of inspiration, while Andrew opened her eyes to what she could aspire to as an Indigenous artist, and how it was possible to bring multiple media into conversation in one’s work (Cole, pers. comm. 2009). Cole has also been mentored by the writer and artistic director Donna Jackson, who in the past had worked with Cole’s mother, Vicki, a writer of plays and short stories. Cole works with a range of manual and digital cameras, and all of her images are resolved with some degree of digital manipulation using programs such as Photoshop and Illustrator. For her 2008 solo exhibition 'Post Us’ at Boscia Galleries, Cole storyboarded the images, sourced costumes, props and models and shot the series in a studio on medium format film. Having processed and scanned the film, Cole then undertook a labour-intensive digital manipulation process using Photoshop, whereby the figures were cut out from the studio backgrounds and assimilated with backdrops which Cole had hand painted and photographed. Cole also created a soundscape to accompany these works in the exhibition space.Cole’s choice of subject and her portrayal of them are always underpinned by some kind of social commentary and critique. Her works seek to draw attention to the way the category of Aboriginality, as it is constructed and policed by non-Indigenous Australians, circumscribes the variety of experiences that constitute contemporary Aboriginal Australian identity. A number of her recent works have explored controversial themes and individuals. Her portrait of the Aboriginal boxer Anthony Mundine, Do you like what you see (2007), received the Boscia Galleries Award for Photography at the 2007 Victorian Indigenous Art Awards. This work was inspired by the fact that The Daily Telegraph had refused to cover one of the boxer’s super-middleweight title fights that was taking place in Australia, as punishment for comments he had made about the prevalence of discrimination against Aboriginal sportsmen (Media Watch 2007). By presenting Mundine as self-absorbed and vulnerable, Cole’s image offered a counterpoint to his abrasive and outspoken public persona. Another portrait of Mundine, titled Nothing to Hide was shortlisted for the National Photographic Portrait Prize in 2007. In How to be a Domestic Goddess (2008), “Foxy”, an Aboriginal drag queen, stands in her glistening kitchen looking out the window. This work was shortlisted for the 2008 Telstra National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards and the 2008 Victorian Indigenous Art Awards. In 2008 Cole was commissioned by the Unity Foundation to produce a calendar titled Men in Black, consisting of photographic portraits of male Aboriginal sports stars. The calendar sought to contribute to the reappraisal of black masculinity in Australia, and sought to raise funds for the Foundation, which is a not-for-profit organisation devoted to assisting marginalised Indigenous and non-Indigenous people to achieve success and wellbeing through social programs, events, mentoring and education. Such objectives resonate with Cole’s own ideals: at the core of her sense of purpose as an artist is a desire to instill pride amongst members of the Aboriginal community, and to create positive images of Aboriginal people that can counteract the negative portrayals that she feels are prevalent in the Australian media (Cole &amp; Browning 2009).2008 also saw Cole exhibit a series of works titled Not Really Aboriginal in a solo exhibition at the Centre for Contemporary Photography in Melbourne as part of the 2008 Next Wave Festival. Not Really Aboriginal commented on the contestation of light-skinned, urban-based Aboriginal people’s identity, a contestation familiar to Cole herself:“I’ve always been told that I was Aboriginal. I never questioned it because of the colour of my skin or where I lived. My Nan, part of the Stolen Generation, was staunchly proud and strong. She made me feel the same way. My land takes in Ballarat, Geelong and Werribee and extends west past Cressy to Derrinallum… All the descendants of traditional Victorian Aboriginal people are now of mixed heritage. I’m not black. I’m not from a remote community. Does that mean I’m not really Aboriginal?” (Cole in CCP 2008).The series includes portraits and family scenes in which the subjects’ faces are blackened with minstrel paint. While she was formulating her ideas on how to approach the subject of being a light-skinned Aboriginal person, Cole learnt that a Melbourne costume shop stocked tins of Minstrel Black and Negro Brown pancake make-up, imported from New York. As Cole related to Daniel Browning on ABC Radio’s Awaye program, she was compelled to work with 'blackface’ because: “I had to take that old stereotype, or that old racist visual cue and flip it on its head” (Cole &amp; Browning 2009). In the work Wathaurung Mob (2008), Cole and her relatives are arranged as a family group and have adopted serious, almost regal poses. The understated clothing and interior creates an impression of benign domesticity, however this homeliness is offset by the impact of the painted faces, the red bandannas and the way the subjects hold the viewer’s gaze. This work, among others, was included in the exhibition 'Inheritance’, shown at the Australian Centre for Photography in Sydney (2009). Three works from the Not Really Aboriginal series were acquired by the Art Gallery of Western Australia in 2008. In 2008 Cole produced a series of collaborative works with Aboriginal sculptor Lorraine Connelly-Northey for the exhibition 'A Time Like This’ at the Margaret Lawrence Gallery of the Victorian College of the Arts. 'A Time Like This’ commemorated a century of women’s suffrage in Victoria, and this series, which was acquired by the Koori Heritage Trust, took the historical objectification and control of Aboriginal women as its theme. In designing the works, Cole and Connelly-Northey collaborated with the Koori artist and writer Jirra Lulla Harvey. Harvey is a close creative associate of Cole’s; she curated and wrote the exhibition essay for 'A Time Like This’, and in 2009 Cole and Harvey were working together on a project involving the transsexual/transgender community on the Tiwi Islands.Besides St Kilda, Cole has also lived in Newport and in 2009 was living in Altona North, which is on the shores of Port Phillip Bay just west of Melbourne. Alongside her art practice, she works as a freelance photographer for community events, and within the arts and music industry.

Olive Cotton,"
photographer, was born on 11 July 1911 in Hornsby, Sydney. At the age of eleven she was given a Kodak Box Brownie camera and taught the basics in photography by her father, Leo Cotton, Professor of Geology at Sydney University. Her mother Florence, née Channon, was interested in the arts and music. Olive attended the Methodist Ladies College, Burwood, in 1921-29, and Sydney University in 1930-34, graduating BA. She joined the Photographic Society of NSW and the Sydney Camera Club in 1929. In mid-1934 she began to work with her childhood friend, Max Dupain , in his newly opened studio at 24 Bond Street, Sydney. Her photographs were included in the London Salon of Photography in 1935 ( Teacup Ballet ) and 1937 ( Shasta Daisies and Winter Willows ). She was a member of the short-lived Contemporary Camera Group in 1938.
In 1939 Olive Cotton married Max Dupain; they separated two years later and divorced in 1944. Cotton taught mathematics at Frensham School, Mittagong (NSW), in 1941. From 1942-45 she managed the Max Dupain studio while Dupain was on war service. Her photographs of the Sturt Craft Workshops at Frensham were published in the book, Sturt (Wahroonga NSW, 1946), and her photographs of flower arrangements were included in Flower Pieces (Sydney 1946) by Helen Blaxland (mother of Antonia Blaxland ).
Cotton moved to Koorawatha near Cowra in 1946 with her second husband, Ross McInerney, whom she had married in 1944; daughter Sally was born in 1946 and son Peter two years later. Cotton taught mathematics at Cowra High School from 1959-63. In 1964 she opened a photographic studio in Cowra specialising in portraiture, especially of children, and wedding photography.
In the 1980s Cotton’s photographs once again began to receive serious attention. They were included in Gael Newton’s exhibition, 'Silver and Grey’ (Art Gallery of New South Wales), in 1980 and in the 1981-82 touring exhibition 'Australian Women Photographers 1890-1950’, organised by Barbara Hall and Jenni Mather. In 1983 Cotton was awarded a Visual Arts Board grant to print photographs for the retrospective exhibition, 'Olive Cotton Photographs 1924-1984’, which opened at the Australian Centre for Photography in 1985 and subsequently toured. Light Years , a film by Kathryn Millard on Olive Cotton’s life and work, was released in 1991. In the same year Teacup Ballet was issued on a stamp to mark the 150th anniversary of photography in Australia. Olive Cotton was awarded an Emeritus Fellowship from the Australia Council in 1993.


"
Noel Counihan,"
painter, printmaker, cartoonist and caricaturist, was born in South Melbourne. Although he attended evening classes at the National Gallery School in 1930, he was mostly self-taught as an artist. He did a linocut cover for the second issue of Proletariat (organ of the Melbourne University Labor Club) vol.1 no.2, July 1932 and drew weekly caricatures for the Melbourne Argus from 1935. He also did caricatures for the Bulletin , Table Talk and Sun News-Pictorial during the Depression years. As 'Cunningham’ he did the cover 'Port Kembla Solidarity’ for the Trade Union Leader (Central organ of militant unionism), vol.1, no.8, March 1936 and the linocut Tycoon , 1931 (initialled 'C’ for Cunningham; copy owned Pat Counihan lent to S.H. Ervin black and white show). The Art Gallery of Western Australia has an original 1937 caricature of H.M. Jackson done for the Bulletin (957/0D54) and the Mitchell Library also owns original caricatures of various prominent men, now mostly forgotten.
Influenced by George Finey , the German Simplicissimus artists and the full-page cartoons of the American William Gropper in the left-wing journal New Masses , Counihan contributed to publications in London, Melbourne, Sydney, New Zealand (gallery of prominent New Zealanders, NZ Observer 1939-41), Warsaw and Prague. He began painting in 1941; he also made lots of prints. In Melbourne he was a foundation member of the Workers’ Art Club and of the Print Council of Australia (later president); for a time he was chairman of the Victorian Printmakers’ Group. He was one of ten artists in the 'Melbourne Popular Art Group’ who produced a folio of fourteen linocuts, Eureka 1854-1954 (Melbourne 1954), paying tribute to 'the stand of the Ballarat miners in the Eureka Stockade’ (copy Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery); numbers 2 (“Joe! Joe! The Traps are coming”), 4 ('The Magistrate’) and 5 ('On Bakery Hill’) are his.
Counihan’s contributions to Overland included writing and illustrating 'Scenes of Venice’, no.9 (autumn 1957), 20-21, 'Russian Scenes’, 10 (spring 1957), 20-21, etc.
IMAGE: 'Albert Namatjira’ 1959, linocut edn 50 (copies at Queensland Art Gallery [QAG]; Art Gallery of New South Wales; National Gallery of Australia; et al.). Counihan first met Namatjira in February 1954 and sketched his portrait. Five years later, when Namatjira was being prosecuted for providing liquor to his extended family, Counihan organised a letter of protest to the Menzies Government. In 1959, the year of this linocut, Counihan wrote passionately in Namatjira’s support in Tribune (1 April). Namatjira died three months after his release from prison (see Bernard Smith biog.). The print was included in Sotheby’s Fine Australian Paintings 22-23 April 1996, cat.344 with this information (estimate $500-800).
He also drew a caricature of Mick Armstrong of the Age with his nose being manipulated by the bosses to draw cartoons (ill. King, 1st edn, p. 136).
Worked for Worker or Common Cause cartoon of the 1930s? “An Important Conversation” (man and woman in street) and “In a Foundry” (working men in foreground and two bosses on other side of wall) are two of the six lithographs in his 1948 folio done in Simplissimus style (QAG). A folio of six linocuts (1959) includes “Peace means Life”, “Strontium 90”, “Hunger” and “An Old Man”. The Broadsheet (8 issues, QAG; donated Pat Corrigan) was a large single sheet of relief prints, screenprinting and printer’s type on contemporary social issues, produced in six issues at Melbourne from October 1967 to July 1971. No.1 (1967), screenprint with typset text on paper, edn. 372/1000, 63.5 × 50.5cm, anti-Vietnam 'Napalm Sunday – Coming next year – Ash Wednesday’, was illustrated by Noel Counihan et al. Counihan was also in no.4, 'Up You Cazaly’ (the football issue), 1968, and in no.6, 'A Time for Peace’, 1979. In 1998 Josef Lebovic was offering Counihan’s 'The Good Life’, 1968, pen and wash, for $7,500.
The 1999 S.H. Ervin b/w show included 9 works by Counihan from the Pat Counihan collection: the linocuts 'Tycoon’ (1931), 'Albert Namatjira’ (1959), 'Laughing Christ’ (1970) and 'Demonstrator’ (1978), the original ink cartoon 'The Crisis Facing Us – From the “Land of the Golden Fleece” to Monopoly Capitalism, Censorship and Repression’ (not dated), and three bronze cartoons done late in life (1970s?), 'Laughing Christ’, 'Rabelais’ and two versions of 'On the blower’, depicting a capitalist on the phone, one naked.

Adam Cullen,"
Adam Cullen, painter and Archibald Prize winner, was born in Sydney in 1963. He studied Fine Arts and Professional Art Studies at the City Art Institute in Paddington, initially graduating in 1987. Later he returned as a research student when the former CAE joined the He  University of New South Wales, graduating with a Master of Fine Arts in 1999. Despite his apparent conventional academic trajectory, Cullen was initially best known for his confrontational stunts and punkish ploys. In one performance he walked around for a week with a severed pig’s head chained to his ankle, during which time he was banned from public transport. His friend and fellow student, Andrew Frost, saw this as an indication of his long term obsession with decay and death.Cullen’s most challenging performance piece was held at the Museum of Contemporary Art in 2005. Home Economics consisted of Cullen and fellow artist Cash Brown, standing at a table with various domestic appliances and easily purchased ingredients. Then as Cullen read from sources found on the internet, Brown drew accompanying diagrams to show how weapons of mass destruction could be made by all.His joy in challenging authority can be seen in his later collaboration with Mark 'Chopper’ Read on a children’s book entitled Hooky the Cripple . Cullen’s work approached difficult social issues with a light touch. Crime, masculinity and cowboy culture, were all exposed through a lens of humour. Formally, his paintings united high and low culture through the combination of bold, gestural brushstrokes and appropriated imagery. Cullen was the recipient of a number of distinguished prizes most famously the Archibald Prize in 2000 for his portrait of the actor David Wenham. Ice was also a regular  finalist in the Archibald, the Sulman and the Blake Prize. In 2002 Cullen represented Australia at the 25th Bienal de Sao Paulo.For many years he suffered from ill health, which was exacerbated by a life style characterised by drugs and heavy drinking. At the time of his death he was a diabetic, and had his pancreas removed and was heavily medicated, not for pleasure but for survival. Andrew Frost wrote 'Adam has left us his legacy: the good, the bad and the ugly, the funny, the insightful and glacial glistening of truth, the dancing black line, the splat of curdled enamel on the infinity of a single colour acrylic. It wasn’t conceptual he always said, it was optical. Just look and you will see.’


"
Nici Cumpston,"
Barkindji photographer, Nici Cumpston was born in Adelaide in August 1963. She spent her childhood growing up in Broken Hill (NSW), Alice Springs and Darwin (NT) and in the province of Manitoba in central Canada, returning to live in South Australia in 1979. Her family background is Aboriginal, Afghan, English and Irish. In a lecture given in 2002 at The Kluge Ruhe Aboriginal Art Collection of the University of Virginia (USA), Alison Holland stated that it was important for Cumpston that people know about this mixed cultural background “in order to set the scene, as she is intent on showing the diversity amongst all. Nicole says, 'I don’t particularly look like any of these nationalities and I want people to know how different we all are.’”Cumpston’s artistic career began when she enrolled in a Diploma of Applied and Visual Art with the North Adelaide School of Art in 1987 (graduating in 1989) and held her first exhibition, 'Doubts’, at the Adelaide Fringe Festival in 1988. It was at the art school that Cumpston was taught the technique of hand colouring photographs with transparent oil paints by Kate Breakey who was employed to present a photographic workshop to the students. This is the style of photography that Cumpston would gain recognition for later in her career.For the next eight years Cumpston worked in Photographics for the South Australian Police Department where she processed the slide film used in the new speed and red light cameras that were being introduced across South Australia. She also processed and printed crime scene, accident investigation and forensic autopsy films. This work taught Cumpston to be proficient with colour film processing and printing and the importance of daily equipment maintenance and testing procedures. It also provided her with an understanding of colour printing methods including how to read a print to enable accurate colour correction. In correspondence with the author, Cumpston has said that she is “not sure if it is through seeing the process of documenting crime scenes that I have developed a way of documenting the landscape looking for evidence of past Aboriginal occupation. I feel like I am an investigator when I go out into the bush as I am always photographing everything I see, like I am gathering evidence.”During her time with the South Australian Police Department Cumpston completed her Advanced Diploma of Applied and Visual Art, again at the North Adelaide School of Art (1992-1994) where she furthered her studies in photography and took courses in ceramics and textiles. Upon leaving the Police Department in 1996 Cumpston began lecturing in photography at the Tauondi Aboriginal Community College in Port Adelaide, South Australia – a position she held until 2006. From 1998 to 2004, while working at the College, Cumpston undertook and completed her Bachelor of Visual Art and her Honours degree at the University of South Australia, majoring in photography, where she learnt to experiment with many different photographic techniques including working with a variety of films and papers including digital and infra-red film. Her exhibiting career did not rest during these work and study years. In 1998 Cumpston participated in her first major exhibition, ’3 Views of Kaurna Territory Now’ (curated by Vivonne Thwaites) with fellow photographers Darren Siwes and Agnes Love at the Adelaide Festival Centre.In 1999, when Cumpston was in the second year of her Bachelor degree, her mother passed away. Though struggling with grief, Cumpston continued with her studies. Later that same year she was commissioned by the State Library of South Australia to work in collaboration with Adelaide based photographer Andrew Dunbar. Cumpston and Dunbar’s brief for the State Library was to create a series of portraits of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, which was the launch exhibition of the 2000 Adelaide Festival of Arts. This exhibition, titled 'Nakkondi/Look – Indigenous Australians 1999-2000’, was then invited to tour to Noumea in October 2000 for the 8th Festival of Pacific Arts. In her Kluge Ruhe lecture, Alison Holland described the images taken by Cumpston and Dunbar as “a snapshot of 'real’ lives of indigenous Australians across the spectrum of experience” and said that both the photographers “approached the project with 'open eyes’ and invite their audience to do likewise: to look and see Aboriginal people as they really are, not as they may be conventionally portrayed.” Again, in correspondence with the author, Cumpston stated that working with Dunbar provided a great opportunity for her as he set a very high standard and she had to “work hard and learnt quickly how to create images that pleased everyone involved.”Cumpston was commissioned again in 2000, this time by the Centenary of Federation to work on another collaboration titled Weaving the Murray. Seven Indigenous and non-Indigenous artists were commissioned to literally weave the social and cultural histories of the Murray River. Initially brought into this project as a documentary photographer, Cumpston ended up becoming involved in the weaving practices of the other participants and helped with the creation of the giant woven Murray Cod, Ponde. Whilst working on this project Cumpston learnt that her family was not only connected with the Darling River but also the Murray. Creating more images than was required by the commissioning agents, Cumpston utilised the extra photographs to stage her first solo exhibition, 'Reflections’, at Tandanya in 2002. At the same time as preparing for 'Reflections’, Cumpston was chosen to work as the assistant to her old mentor and now friend, Kate Breakey, who was on a trip home from the United States participating in the Returning Artists Residency, a South Australian School of Art, (University of South Australia) initiated project. Breakey in turn worked with Cumpston on producing the photographs for the “Reflections” exhibition and encouraged her to hand colour the work, a series of mural sized images of the Murray River.After her father’s passing in 2005, Cumpston took time away from work and travelled to Breakey’s home in Tucson, Arizona, (USA) to grieve. During this six-week trip Cumpston worked with Breakey as her studio assistant on Breakey’s forthcoming exhibitions. Upon her return to Australia Cumpston took up a four-week arts residency at the Bundanon Trust on the south coast of New South Wales. Following this residency she began a large commission of pencil and water-coloured hand painted photographs for the Commonwealth Law Court building in Adelaide. During this commission Cumpston had to change her technique of printing as the rolls of photographic paper she always worked with were no longer in production. For this commission she created the images on film. Negatives from the processed film were scanned and printed onto canvas. This new technique came about after experimenting with different papers resembling the type she was accustomed to working with that would allow her to continue using transparent oil paints. Not finding any that satisfied her, she moved to canvas, substituting transparent watercolour for oil paint when she found that oils rubbed the photographic image from the new surface. The end result of this work was installed in foyer of the building along a 12 metre and a 5 metre wall. The works titled Eckerts Creek, Murray River National Park and Flooded Gum, Katarapko Creek are large panormaic images of the waterways and trees of the Murray River. In correspondence with the author, Cumpston has said of this body of work that she hoped that people would “feel as though they are in the country even though they are within a building in the city.”Cumpston began to be nationally noticed as an artistic photographer when she was invited to submit work for consideration for the 2006 Xstrata Coal Emerging Indigenous Art Award at the Queensland Art Gallery which led to her first Sydney solo exhibition at Cooee Aboriginal Art Gallery later that year. In 2007 Cumpston entered the River Murray Art Prize, for which she won the People’s Choice Award. That same year Judith Ryan included her in the Heide Museum of Modern Art exhibition, “Power and Beauty: Indigenous Art Now” from November 2007 to March 2008. Her work sat alongside the works of Fiona Foley, Lin Onus, Gordon Hookey, Vernon Ah Kee, Richard Bell, and Julie Gough, Ray Thomas, Ellen Jose, Philip Gudthaykudthay, Samantha Hobson, Ricardo Idagi, Ellen José, Ricky Maynard, Clinton Nain, Wingu Tingima, Gulumbu Yunupingu and twenty artists from the Kayili Artists and the Warakuna Artists groups, both of the Gibson Desert, Western Australia, including Coiley Campbell Tjakamarra, Dorothy Ward Nangala, Eunice Yunurupa Porter Panaka and Molly Malungka Yates Tjarurru.From 2006 to 2008 Cumpston worked at the University of South Australia where she wrote and delivered a new compulsory course, 'Indigenous Arts, Culture and Design’ for the undergraduate visual art and design students. In 2007 Cumpston, with Nerina Dunt, co-curated 'Indigenous Responses to Colonialism: Another Story’ at Artspace, Adelaide Festival Centre (her first professional curatorial experience). In that same year she worked alongside Julie Gough as the Project Manager for Gough’s South Australian School of Art residency.In 2008 Cumpston began working full time as an assistant curator of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art at the Art Gallery of South Australia, the gallery’s first Indigenous identified curatorial position. Marita Smith’s Gallerysmith also began representing her in Melbourne, this was the first commercial gallery to represent the artist.

Lyndon Dadswell,"
Lyndon Dadswell (1908-1986) was one of Australia’s most accomplished sculptors, and the first sculptor to be appointed an official war artist during the Second World War. He studied at the Julian Ashton School from 1923 to 1925 and at the East Sydney Technical College from 1926 to 1929. He was a student of the influential sculptor Rayner Hoff, and in 1929, at the age of 21, worked as an assistant to Paul Montford on the Shrine of Remembrance in Melbourne. There, he was responsible for the 12 sandstone panels of the inner frieze in the shrine’s interior. Dadswell also created the Newcastle, NSW, WWII memorial, a giant bronze group of elongated modernist figures somewhat in the style of Giacometti, the subject of a SMH cartoon by George Molnar. After the war, he circulated widely around artistic and architectural circles, and was a friend of Margo and Gerald Lewers.Source—Website www.awm.gov.au/aboutus/artist_profiles/dadswell.htm

Janet Dawson,"
Janet Dawson has had a distinguished career as an abstract and figurative painter and printmaker. Dawson studied at the National Gallery School in Melbourne and in 1952 the National Gallery of Victoria awarded her a Travelling Scholarship to London where she studied at the Slade School and Central School. In the 1960s she designed Laminex-based furniture for Gallery A in Sydney ca.1964, one item of which is in the Queensland Art Gallery Collection. 
After Dawson moved to Binalong, NSW, in 1973 her work became, as Andrew Sayers says, “engaged with the qualities of the natural world: not only the landscape, but the sheen of birds’ feathers, the shapes of growing things, the endless pictorial possibilities of vegetables tended in the garden”. Since this time Dawson has been concerned with reflecting her own world. In 2006 a travelling survey exhibition of Dawson’s work began at the Bathurst Regional Gallery, and travelled to the SH Ervin Gallery, Queensland University Art Museum, Tasmanian Art Gallery and Mornington Peninsular Art Gallery. Prior survey exhibitions have been held at the National Gallery of Victoria (1979) and the National Gallery of Australia (1996). Her work is held in major Australian and international collections including the Royal Society, London.

"
Destiny Deacon,"
Destiny Deacon was born in 1957 in Maryborough, Queensland. Her heritage is of the K’ua K’ua and Erub/Mer people of the Torres Strait Islands. She was raised in Melbourne and today lives and works out of her lounge room/studio in Brunswick, Victoria. In 1979 she received a Bachelor of Arts degree, majoring in politics at the University of Melbourne, and in 1981 she received a Diploma of Education from La Trobe University, after which she worked as a history teacher in Victoria’s secondary and community schools, and as a tutor and lecturer in Australian Writing and Culture and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Cultural Production at Melbourne University. Inspired by her mother, Deacon eventually followed her passion for politics and became one of ‘Charlie’s Angels’, working for Aboriginal activist Dr. Charles Perkins as a staff trainer in Canberra, before beginning her professional photography career in 1990.  
Destiny Deacon’s family ancestry can be traced back over one hundred and fifty years to William Pitt, Prime Minister of England from 1783 to 1804, who fathered children by one of his slaves in Kingston, Jamaica. Deacon’s parents were Eleanor Harding, a Torres Strait Island woman from Darnley Island, far north Queensland, and Jack Harding, a white wharf labourer from Maroubra, in Sydney’s south. In 1956, they settled with their children in the Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy, amongst a community of Aboriginal people that had been established in the period between the two world wars. Many Indigenous people, and merchant seamen from around the world were drawn to the area because of work opportunities and Fitzroy became an important social and cultural hub. Soon after arriving there, however, the Harding couple separated and Destiny and her siblings were raised by their mother. Despite living in poverty the family survived with the support of the tight-­knit community. 
Eleanor first became politically involved in Aboriginal community affairs in the 1960s, through the Aborigines Advancement League with which she campaigned for citizenship during the 1967 referendum. She eventually became involved in Indigenous Women’s issues through the United Council of Aboriginal Women. Diagnosed with cancer in 1996, Eleanor died that same year leaving behind seven children, seven grandchildren, and a much-­celebrated life dedicated to the fight for Aboriginal rights. Deacon’s siblings include Clinton Nain, a renowned visual artist, dancer, performer and storyteller, and writer, performer and broadcaster Johnny Harding. 
Deacon became interested in photography at an early age, snapping pictures of family and friends with a Kodak Instamatic camera. It was not until she was in her 30s, however, that she began her professional photographic career, seeing it as a way to express herself and her political beliefs. A self-­taught artist known primarily for her photographs and videos, she also works in the mediums of installation and performance, as well as in writing and broadcasting. Considered one of Australia’s leading Indigenous artists, Deacon’s work subverts the kitsch knickknacks of her own domestic life to expose the racial politics of post colonialism still at work within contemporary Australian society. Much of her work aims to ‘rescue’ and elevate collectible objects of ‘Aboriginalia’ that she finds derogatory. Employing what she describes as low-­budget techniques, Deacon uses her own brand of complex humour and scathing wit to play on common Indigenous clichés. She says about her work: “I like to think there’s a laugh and a tear in every picture.” Her photographs often place a black dolly in the role of protagonist, acting out narratives that explore notions of gender and sexuality. Deacon embraces the immediacy of Polaroid photography and other low-­tech methods, which imbue her images with a strong visual aesthetic. Her constructed photographs create imaginary worlds, and operate as stage sets upon which her characters reenact scenes of oppression. The work addresses issues of poverty, racial discrimination and alienation, and exposes the lingering effects of Australia’s violent colonial history.
Tired of white photographers’ limited depictions of Aborigines, and eager to express her own views visually, Deacon launched her exhibition career in 1990, and it quickly gained momentum. She held her first show, ‘Pitcha Mi Koori’, as part of the Melbourne Fringe Festival, and in 1991, her work was included in ‘Aboriginal Women’s Exhibition’, curated by Hetti Perkins, at the Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney. Her work Tax free kangaroos, included in the 1991 exhibiton ‘Kudjeris’ at Boomalli Aboriginal Artists Cooperative, saw the beginning of her use of dolls and souvenir toys as subject matter. Throughout her work, Deacon focuses primarily on people, interchanging portraits of friends and relatives with inanimate dolls, using both to invert the colonial gaze and overturn the use of the Aboriginal figure as object of curiosity. Deacon describes her work as being ”about (re)creating a world of my own outside my own world.”
Her first solo exhibition, ‘Caste Offs’, was held in 1993 at the Australian Centre for Photography in Sydney, concurrent with a show by artist and curator Brenda Croft. In 1994, her work was included in several group exhibitions in Australia, including ‘Blakness: Blak City Culture!’ at the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art in Melbourne. Also that year, her video Welcome to My Koori World was included in the show ‘An Eccentric Orbit: Video Art in Australia’ at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The piece was part of a sequence of videos created with fellow artist Michael Riley, in which they play zany characters in an absurdist melodrama, filmed almost entirely in a kitchen setting. Screened by ABC TV as part of the 'Blackout’ series, the videos were amongst the early mini-­television soap operas popular with Indigenous viewers.
1994 was also the year that Deacon participated in the fifth Havana Biennial in Cuba, in an exhibition entitled 'Tyerabarrbowaryaou  II : I shall never become a white man’. The show was curated specifically for the Biennial by Fiona Foley and Djon Mundine and included other prominent Aboriginal artists such as Ron Hurley and Robert Campbell Jnr. Following the hugely successful show of the same name, originally exhibited at the MCA in 1992, it was the first exhibition of contemporary Aboriginal Art to be commissioned by the MCA and it eventually toured throughout eastern Australia. Deacon’s 1997 solo exhibition, ‘No Fixed Dress’ at Gallery Gabrielle Pizzi in Melbourne was held in conjunction with the Melbourne Fashion Festival. The title of the show refers to the Aboriginal reggae rock band, No Fixed Address, whose song lyrics romanticise the ‘Aboriginal Woman’, but whom Deacon strips of any nostalgic notions. The 1998 show ‘Postcards from Mummy’, held at the Australian Centre for Photography, documented Deacon’s voyage to her mother’s homeland in the Torres Strait Islands, a poignant retracing of her mother’s life two years after her death.
In 2001, Roslyn Oxley9 Gallery in Sydney featured her photographic work for the first time, in the exhibition ‘Forced into Images’. The photographs follow the life of an Aboriginal girl, from childhood to adulthood, through a dark landscape fraught with domestic violence. The semi-­autobiographical series draws its title from a quote by Alice Walker, the African American author and poet: 'I see our brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, captured and forced into images, doing hard time for all of us’.
Deacon’s work was featured in a solo exhibition, ‘Walk & don’t look blak’ curated by Natalie King, at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney in 2004. The first major retrospective of her work, the show displayed the breadth of her practice, including works of photography, video, installation and performance. The exhibition subsequently toured to the Ian Potter Museum of Art at Melbourne University, the Adam Art Gallery and the Wellington City Gallery in Wellington, New Zealand, the Tjibao Cultural Centre in Noumea, New Caledonia and the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography in Japan. Deacon’s work was included in the survey ‘2004: Australian Culture Now’ at The Australian Centre for the Moving Image in Melbourne, for which she was commissioned to create a film for the programme 'Neighbours (the remix)’. With the help of her frequent collaborator, Virginia Fraser, she produced the absurdist Aboriginal comedy Over d-­fence, a series of hilarious sketches performed by friends and family members. Situated in a suburban backyard, the work’s subtle details evoke the ‘horror signifiers’ of Australia’s colonial past. A looped cord hanging next to a black doll, for example, creates a haunting juxtaposition -­ the simple detritus of mass culture rearranged into a nightmarish scene.
In 2008, Deacon participated in the 16th Biennale of Sydney, entitled ‘Revolutions – Forms That Turn’. Again working with Fraser, she created an installation specifically for the Biennale, the provocative piece Occupied, which was situated in the Botanical Gardens. A long-­time friend of Deacon, Fraser is a Melbourne-­‐based artist,curator, and writer, and since first joining Roslyn Oxley9 in 2001, the pair has shown work there nearly every year. Together they have created works such as Fence Sitters, a series of photographs and woven works, including cushion covers and carpets, shown at the Melbourne Art Fair in 2008. Destiny Deacon’s work is held in most major Australian museums, as well as in international collections, and she is represented in Europe by Galleria Raffaella Cortese in Milan, Italy.

William Delafield-Cook,
Karla Dickens,"
Karla Dickens, Wiradjuri painter, was born in Sydney in 1967. Dickens enrolled in Life Drawing classes at high school where the female form was her main subject matter. She began her formal training as an artist when she enrolled at the National Art School in Darlinghurst, Sydney in 1991, obtaining a Fine Arts Diploma in 1993 and a Bachelor in Fine Arts in 2000.  After moving to Wollombi in the Hunter Valley, NSW Dickens says her work became “more detailed with a stronger Indigenous feel.” She also says that her work at this time was about finding “more acceptance with my sexuality”. Following the death of a close friend in 1997 crosses began appearing as motifs within her paintings and in 2000 Dickens began incorporating text into her work. Her work in 2003 changed dramatically when Dickens began beading onto painted canvasses, a strong contrast of fresh mark making and fine textured detail. Her inspirations as stated in a 2007 interview with the author are “politics, love, sex and the environment”.  Dickens has shown in many solo and group exhibitions including “The Art of Place” at Old Parliament House, Canberra in 1998, “Co-Existence” at Hogarth Galleries, Sydney in 1998, “Love Magic” at S.H. Ervin Gallery, Sydney for Perspecta 1999, “Aboriginal Ways of Knowing” at the Macy Gallery, Columbia University, USA in 2001, “Hung, Drawn and Quartered” at the Tin Sheds Gallery, University of Sydney in 2003, “Nice Coloured Dolls”, 24HR Art, Darwin, Northern Territory in 2004, “Our Spirit Our Country – Bundjalung Art Award” and “Chrysalis” both at Lismore Regional Art Gallery in 2006.  In his article, “Where Eagles Hover” (Artlink, Volume 18, No 1) Maurice O’Riordan writes of Dickens’ work in her 1997 solo exhibition “Jowalbinna” (home of the ancient ones), “Dickens’ paintings show that the spirituality powering Aboriginal art is well and truly alive. In her series’ title painting, Jowalbinna, a host of 'mother earth’ deities dominates the shelters and the full moon nightscape of Dickens’ passage to them. A wedge-tailed eagle hovers above a footprint, coming to signify the hovering circle of eagles over the Guugu-yalanji people’s historic handover ceremony at the nearby Laura Aboriginal Dance Festival that year”. O’Riordan continues, “for brevity’s sake, it is not possible to detail all of the works in “Jowalbinna”. Each one celebrates a dream-like revelation through country whose spiritual and natural heritage can only inspire profound awe and respect. There’s a kind of magic in the way that Dickens connects with this country, though she was, like a tourist, experiencing it for the first time.”  Dickens had a residency in Brewarrina in 1995 where she worked with 10 local children on a 16-metre mural. In 1997 she was the artist in residence at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), Sydney and spent three months in Cape York, Queensland. In 1998 she had a two-month residency in Guardella, Italy. In 2006 Dickens was the recipient of the Bundjalung Art Award and the People’s Choice Award for her work in the “Our Spirit, Our Country” exhibition.

Peter Dombrovskis,"
 Peter Dombrovskis was born in 1945 to Latvian parents Karl and Adele. In 1950 Dombrovskis and his mother left Europe for Sydney. The following year, they travelled to Hobart which would become an important place for Dombrovskis and where he would spend most of his adult life. They briefly lived at Aldridge Lodge in Hobart, the home of Joan Allport, before settling in Fern Tree, a suburb situated on the shoulder of Mount Wellington. Adele possessed a great passion for the wild and the two spent much of Dombrovskis’ childhood walking in the Tasmanian woods and rainforest gullies.  Dombrovskis was influenced by the Lithuanian-Australian photographer and conservationist Olegas Truchanas whom he met when he was about seventeen years old. Truchanas introduced Dombrovskis to many outdoor pursuits including skiing and canoeing. They developed a close friendship and Dombrovskis is noted for describing himself as Truchanas’ disciple. Truchanas died in 1972 and at this point Dombrovskis asserted his intentions to carry on from where his friend left off – to finish the work Truchanas had started.   Dombrovskis’ first photographic publication was a calendar of images of urban, rural and wilderness areas of Tasmania for the year 1973 which sold out upon its release. The following year he married Gabrielle and they had five children together: Olivia, Nicholas, David, Timothy and Monica.  In 1977 he published his first calendar featuring purely wilderness photographs and his first book, The Quiet Land. The same year, Dombrovskis founded the company, West Wind Press. In 1979 he began to work with Robert Poole, a designer and printer from Melbourne, who would continue to play an active role in Dombrovskis’ wilderness photography publications.  Throughout his life Dombrovskis was intimately involved with the natural environment, not only through photography, but also through exploration, this included walking and canoeing along the rivers he photographed. He was an environmentalist and a conservationist and was deeply saddened by the onset of logging in Tasmania’s ancient forests and the destruction of natural areas through damming projects (Dombrovskis, 1998). He was heavily involved with the 1982 No Dams movement led by the Tasmanian Wilderness Society and Bob Brown (inaugural Parliamentary Leader of the Australian Greens Party). His photograph Morning Mist, Rock Island Bend, Franklin River (1979), of the forested banks of Newland Cascades, appeared in a number of newspapers, including the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age (Melbourne), in the form of a full-page, colour advertisement accompanied by the question, “Could you vote for a party that would destroy this?” This image, like many of Dombrovskis’ photographs, served to drawn attention to wilderness regions of Tasmania under threat. Dombrovskis married his second wife, Liz, in 1987. She had two children from a previous marriage: Ben and Anna.  Dombrovskis was given a 35mm Zeiss camera by Adele at age six; he then moved to a Rolleiflex SL66 and, eventually, to the Linhof Master Technika 5×4 inch flatbed field camera with which he took most of his mature photographs. The practice of using a camera such as the Linhof was similar to the unwieldy process of nineteenth-century photography; it was large and cumbersome and had to be mounted on a tripod in order to take a photograph. Dombrovskis restricted himself to the use of only three lenses: a 90mm Nikkor F4.5, a 150mm Schneider Symar-S and a 300mm Nikkor MF9. He used the medium of colour photography throughout his career.   Dombrovskis’ images possess grandeur and a monumental quality. There is an echo of the sublime character of nature throughout his work, fuelled by his belief in the necessity of preserving the wild world for posterity. Bob Brown has referred to Dombrovskis’ photography as an art born out of a sense of ethics. Dombrovskis’ photography was influenced by other artists, including American environmental photographers Ansel Adams, Edward and Brett Weston and Eliot Porter.  On 28 March 1996, while photographing the Western Arthur Range in Southwest Tasmania, Dombrovskis died of heart failure at the age of fifty-one. After his death, Dombrovskis’ second wife, Liz Dombrovskis, continued to publish his work through the West Wind Press until her retirement in July 2009.  In February 2003 Dombrovskis received the posthumous honour of being inducted into the International Photography Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City, USA. He is the first Australian to receive this award.   Dombrovskis’ work is included in collections of the National Library of Australia, the National Gallery of Australia, the Australian Heritage Commission, the National Gallery of Victoria, Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery, Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, the Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens and the Wilderness Gallery, as well as in many private collections.

Russell Drysdale,"
Sir George Russell Drysdale was born on 7 February 1912 at Bognor Regis in England. His father, also called George Russell Drysdale who led a private life, was the son of George Russell, the pioneer pastoralist who had with his brothers established the Pioneer Sugar mill on the Burdekin River in far north Queensland. His mother, Isobel Gates, was English. In 1919 the family returned to Australia, to the Pioneer plantation. Then, in 1923 they moved to Melbourne where the young Tas, as he was called by family and friends, was sent to Geelong Grammar School. In 1929, his last year of school, Drysdale was discovered to have a detached retina in one eye. As a way of encouraging him to focus, he was given extensive drawing lessons, five days a week.The following year he stayed on another family property at Boxwood, in the Riverina district to help with the shearing before travelling north to Pioneer. His first European travel as an adult was with his uncle Cluny Drysdale in 1931. On his return to Australia he had decided to be a farmer, and settled on the family farm at Boxwood.However when he was in Melbourne recovering from a further eye operation, his surgeon showed some of his drawings to Daryl Lindsay, who suggested that he take art classes with George Bell. When Bell encouraged him to look at modern (Post-Impressionist) art, Drysdale was less than impressed. However on his next journey to Europe in 1932, he saw enough modern art to convince him to move towards a more liberated style, albeit one firmly based in the European academic tradition.In 1935 he married Elizabeth (Bon) Stephen, a friend of Macquarie Gallery’s Lucy Swanton, who encouraged him in his art. After further eye surgery Drysdale renewed his classes with George Bell, and became a friendly rival with fellow student Peter Purves Smith.In 1938 they travelled again to London and Drysdale enrolled in classes with Iain Macnab at the Grosvenor School. He also joined Peter Purves Smith in his Paris studio and painted there with him. The threat of war caused them to return to Australia. In Melbourne Drysdale shared George Bell’s studio, but disliked the acrimonious politics of the Contemporary Art Society. He was now blind in one eye and was not allowed to enlist in the army. Instead he tried managing Boxwood, but realised that he lacked the necessary skills so the family moved to Sydney, and art. The 1940s to the early 1960s were his most productive years. He travelled to the old gold mining town of Hill End and neighbouring Sofala and immortalised the sparse townships of the outback. He drew the devastation of the El Nino drought of the 1940s and turned it into Henry Moore influenced deep red-toned landscape paintings. He honoured the aspirations of the Aboriginal people of the far north, and the harsh life of outback Australians.He did not ignore the family business. In 1947 he joined the Board of Pioneer Sugar Mills, and often visited the property up north which he called his bq). Spiritual homebq). . Russell Drysdale, along with Sidney Nolan, came to characterise the international face of Australian art in the early 1950s. He had frequent successful exhibitions in London, and his work was purchased by both the Tate and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. In 1960 the Art Gallery of New South Wales organised the first scholarly retrospective of his work.His private life was not so fortunate. The suicide of his son Tim in July 1962 was followed by that of his wife Bon in November 1963. Seven months later he married Maisie, the widow of his friend Peter Purves Smith. They bought land outside Gosford on the NSW Central Coast, and there built Bouddi Farm, a place to live and to work. There was little art made in his last years, but he was active as both a member of the Commonwealth Art Advisory Board and the Trustees of the Art Gallery of New South Wales. He was knighted for his services to art in 1969 and died of cancer on 29 June 1981.


"
Brian Dunlop,"
Brian Dunlop was born in Sydney, the son of British parents who had emigrated because of the Great Depression. He later described his father as “a bit of a Calvinist”. On leaving school after the Intermediate Certificate in 1954 he was awarded a scholarship to the state-funded National Art School in Darlinghurst, which meant that his parents encouraged his studies as a way of escaping his working class origins.
He instinctively used the human scale as a way of defining space and proportion, which meant that he readily absorbed the Charm School style promoted by the school’s teachers. Dunlop’s fine drawing style and carefully modulated tonality won him considerable attention in the earlier part of his career. In 1958, the year he completed art school, he was awarded the Le Gay Brereton Prize for drawing, and in 1962 had his first work (a drawing) purchased by the Art Gallery of New South Wales.The same year he travelled to Europe, where he spent most of his time in Italy but also travelled to Greece, Majorca, North Africa and London. He returned to Australia convinced that the humanist values of the Renaissance artists were the right ones to guide his future career. For some years Dunlop was able to supplement his income as an artist with teaching part-time at the National Art School. When that was downgraded to a technical college in the 1970s, he taught at Alexander Mackie College of Advanced Education. Formal teaching ended in 1980 when he became artist in residence at the University of Melbourne. The following year he was awarded the Sulman Prize for his painting of the interior of the Old Physics Building.Dunlop divided his time between Sydney and Ebenezer in NSW and Panton Hill and Port Fairy in Victoria. His careful compositions, where people are defined by their context made him especially popular as a portrait painter. He was not especially enamoured of portrait commissions, preferring to concentrate on landscapes, still lives and architectural interiors, and was known to dismiss portraits as “hack work”.
 For some commissions however, he travelled. In 1984 he travelled to London, to paint the official Victorian Sesquicentenary portrait of queen Elizabeth. The Queen wears in a bright yellow dress, sitting in front of a white panelled door, balanced by and intricate golden patterned  wallpaper. It is clear that he sees her body as an element in an overall composition, and it is no surprise to discover that while she only had brief sittings for the portrait, he spent a great deal of time painting the wallpaper. Despite, or perhaps because of this, Dunlop’s royal portrait is an especially satisfying work.In his later years Brian Dunlop was one of a small group of artists fostered by Eva Breuer, and exhibited regularly with her until his death.

Fiona Foley,"
 Fiona Foley, printmaker, painter, sculptor and photographer was born in Maryborough, Queensland in 1964 and raised in nearby Hervey Bay. These towns and nearby Fraser Islander are all part of her traditional country. Foley grew up surrounded by the stories of her family, the Wondunna clan of the Badtjala people and was influenced by the book, The Legends of the Moonie Jarl (Jacaranda Press, Brisbane, 1964) that was written by her great uncle Wilf Reeves and illustrated by her great aunt, Olga Miller. In 1983 Foley graduated from East Sydney Technical College with a Certificate in Art. From 1984 to 1986 she studied for her Bachelor of Visual Arts at Sydney College of the Arts. In 1987 Foley completed her formal training with a Diploma of Education from the University of Sydney. Foley, along with nine other artists that included Michael Riley, Bronwyn Bancroft and Tracey Moffatt, was a founding member in 1987 of Boomalli Aboriginal Artists Cooperative in Sydney. Boomalli’s aim was to promote the work of Aboriginal artists who did not live in the remote areas of Australia or were supported through federally funded arts centres. Boomalli went on to become the launching pad for many now successful artists besides the founding members. Foley’s portfolio of etchings, paintings, photography and sculpture have afforded her significant recognition as a contemporary artist. Since winning the commission of the Historic Houses Trust of NSW in 1994 to work on the installation The Edge of Trees with Janet Laurence, situated outside the Museum of Sydney, Foley has become known as a successful public artist. She has since been the commissioned artist for other public art projects including, The Lie of the Land, 1997 at the Melbourne Museum and Witnessing to Silence at the Brisbane Magistrates Court in 2004. Her photographic, printing, painting and public art works often speak of the untold and hidden histories of Australia in terms of the colonial interaction with Aboriginal people. Witnessing to Silence informs its audience of Queensland’s documented history of Aboriginal massacres while Black Opium (2006, State Library of Queensland) speaks of Queensland’s 'Aboriginal Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897’ in which the supply and sale of opium to Aboriginal people was stringently legislated against alongside the recommendations to establish Reserves in which Queensland Aboriginal people were forcibly removed to. Foley is one of Australia’s successful international artists whose work is often included in important group exhibitions such as “Global Feminism”, 2007 at the Brooklyn Museum in New York City, USA or solo shows such as “Strange Fruit”, 2006 at the October Gallery in London, England. It is not only Foley’s artwork that is in demand. Her thoughts on Australian history and politics are also being sought and in September 2007 Foley presented a keynote address at the 9th Biennial European Association for Studies of Australia at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark. Other speakers at this conference were Germaine Greer and Mark McKenna from the University of Sydney. Foley works from her home base of Brisbane, Queensland and continues to generate solo exhibitions based on historical, political and social issues of Australian life as well as continuing her career as a public artist.

Donald Friend,"
painter, illustrator and cartoonist, son of L.W. Friend, was educated at Cranbrook, Sydney. After leaving school he spent a year as a jackeroo on his father’s property at Singleton, then returned to Sydney and studied art with Dattilo Rubbo and Sydney Long. In 1936 he was living with his 'companion’ Don Murray in an 80 year-old stable in High Street, Woollahra, with a modernistic fresco painted on its walls – called 'a Bohemia that has gone Japanese’. He was friendly with a group of young gay artists, Wolfgang Cardamatis, Wallace Thornton and Michael Brown, who lived in the stables opposite owned by the painter Mary Edwards; all were keen to go to Europe to seek fame ( Smith’s Weekly 15 August 1936, 10). In fact, they went to war. Friend’s wartime cartoons and story illustrations (reproduced artworks, not direct commissions) appeared in Australia: National Journal and Australia Week-end Book 1 (1942). The latter includes “There goes Ellen, off to her war work” (a dove with a bomb in its beak) and '“I see you admire my orchids, Colonel!” (on low evening dress at a wild party)./ “Tell me, Countess, are they Spectabile Grandiflora or Pendula?”’
He also wrote and illustrated I Go to War , 22-24, and The Door , 110. Other small drawings appeared in vol.3 of the Week-end Book (1944), e.g. p.81. He also contributed drawings to the Home , e.g. people standing round a bush hut, “Now play something from Saties’ Le fils des etoiles”, December 1941, 43; people at a party with Bacchus and Venus, “And now that the seance is concluded, Madame Zara, I wonder if you would be good enough to de-materialise Bacchus and Venus before we have our tea?” March 1941, 13; at a wild party in a garret, “I always say, the world would be a very dull place if we all thought alike” 1 February 1941, 17; family picnic with bombs going off everywhere: “Something always happens when we picnic – Last year Annie sat on an ants’ nest!” 1 December 1941, 42; story and illustrations about an awful party and a talking horse, Life is so rich 1 September 1941, 34-35.
Friend illustrated Ron Saw’s Brief Encounters (Cammeray, NSW: Richard Griffin, 1984) and many other books. He also made etchings, e.g. Birthday Party , Beach Bikies , No Room at the Inn and Chez DF (self portrait: ill.), all c.1987 (edn 50), Josef Lebovic Gallery (1996), and he wrote and illustrated his own books, although he is, of course, best known as a painter. His historical painting, The Arrest of Governor Bligh n.d., oil and gold leaf on board, was offered at Christie’s auction, part 1, on 26 November 1996, lot.118 (ill.).

Gunybi Ganambarr,"
Gunybi Ganambarr has mainly lived and worked as an artist at Gangan, sometimes based at Dhuruputjpi. He is a ceremonial yidaki player who is sought after by elders. Ganambarr accompanied the Yolngu delegations to the opening of the National Museum in Canberra 2001 and the larrakitj installation at the Sydney Opera House, 2002, and played at the opening of Djambawa Marawili’s exhibition in the 2006 Sydney Biennale.
Under the tutelage of artists like Gawirrin Gumana and Yumutjin Wununmurra from his mother’s Dhalwangu clan whilst living on their country he has now assumed ceremonial authority. He has combined that with a startling innovative flair to produce groundbreaking sacred art that is at once novel and still entirely consistent with Yolngu madayin (law).In the year of 2008 he was chosen as an exhibiting finalist in the Xstrata Coal Emerging Indigenous Artist Award at the Gallery of Modern Art at Queensland Art Gallery. He went on to win that Award.


"
Rosalie Gascoigne,"
Rosalie Gascoigne was an Australian Sculptor. She was born at Auckland, New Zealand, on 25 January 1917 in Auckland and died at Canberra, Australia, on 23 October 1999. Gascoigne grew up in New Zealand, however, in 1943 she moved to Stromlo in Canberra, Australia following her marriage to astronomer Ben Gascoigne. 
Gascoigne’s father, Stanley King Walker, was an engineer and her mother, Marion Hamilton Metcalfe, was a secondary school teacher. Gascoigne was the middle child in her family and had an older sister, Daintry, and a younger brother, Douglas. Being a scholastic person was valued in the household and art was frowned upon. Gascoigne went to Auckland University and studied English, French, Latin, Greek and Mathematics from 1935-38, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts. In 1940 she completed a one-year course at Auckland Teacher Training College to become a secondary school teacher. Gascoigne had no formal artistic training, and it was only later in life she discovered her abilities. She experimented with the art of flower arranging in the late 1950s and developed a passion for gardening. Gascoigne then took classes at the Sogetsu School of Ikebana. 
Gascoigne had three children named Martin, Thomas and Hester. Her eldest son, Martin, became involved in the art world, befriending curator James Mollison and later marrying writer and curator Mary Eagle. He thus played an important role in Gascoigne’s artistic career. In 1963 Gascoigne made a trip to Europe and in 1980 she made an art pilgrimage to New York. In 1982 she travelled to Italy for the Venice Biennale. Important contacts that influenced Gascoigne’s artistic development included Carl Plate, Norman Sparnon, James Mollison and Michael Taylor.
A work that highlights Gascoigne’s artmaking practice and the main themes she explored is Great Blond Paddocks.  The work was acquired by the Art Gallery of New South Wales with funds from the Art Gallery of NSW society. Great Blond Paddocks consists of long, narrow, rectangular pieces of sawn wooden soft drink crates arranged on wood. The work captures the undulating, grassy plains and wheat fields of Canberra and its surrounding regions.  In addition it shows the minimalist and abstract qualities of Gascoigne’s art.
Another work of Gascoigne’s is Crop 1 which was initially shown in an exhibition entitled ‘Rosalie Gascoigne: Material as Landscape.’ The show was first at the Art Gallery of NSW, Sydney in 1997 and was taken to the National Gallery, Canberra in 1998. Crop 1 consists of hundreds of dried salsify heads poking through a plane of galvanised chicken wire. They have been compressed, bound and arranged on a silver-grey sheet of galvanised iron. The work symbolises Australian agriculture as it highlights the separation and cultivation of the land. Texture is important in the work, as with Great Blond Paddocks it is evident that the materials have been shaped by their time in the natural environment. 
A key exhibition was Gascoigne’s first solo exhibition at the Macquarie Galleries, Canberra as it was her first recognition by the art establishment. Gascoigne’s second solo exhibition in 1976 was important as at the age of 59 she was hailed by the critics as an exciting and new original artist. In 1982 she Gascoigne selected for the 40th Venice Biennale, becoming the first woman to represent Australia. In 1988 Gascoigne participated in the Australian Biennale where her work gained international recognition. Some of Gascoigne’s prizes include the John McCaughey Prize, the Order of Australia and the Grand Prize at the Cheju Pre-Biennale in Korea. 
Gascoigne’s work is represented in public collections across Australia. Her work is also represented in public collections in New Zealand and the United States of America.  Many of her pieces belong to private collections.


"
George Gittoes,"
 Painter, film maker, printmaker, puppeteer, performance artist, George Noel Gittoes was born in Sydney in 1949, and spent his early years at Rockdale, about three kilometres west of Botany Bay. In 1966, after an unhappy time at Kogarah Boys High, he spent the last two years of high school at Kingsgrove North High, near the family’s new home at Bardwell Park on the East Hills railway line. Gittoes’ early interest in Islamic cultures led him to persuade his art class to specialise in Islamic art for the first NSW Higher School Certificate of 1967. Inspired in part by his sister, the artist Pamela Griffith, and his mother, the potter Joyce Gittoes, George was early interested in making art but despite a precocious talent for drawing, he turned at first to poetry. At the end of school his English teacher, the actor Don Reid, gave each of the advanced English students a copy of Fitzgerald’s translation of Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, which led the young man to read further into Sufi literature.   On leaving school Gittoes enrolled in combined Arts/Law at the University of Sydney. 1968 was the first year Fine Arts (now called 'art history and theory’) was taught to undergraduates. This he found interesting, especially the lecture on Van Gogh which led him to read the artist’s Letters to Theo. Fellow students remember him enthusing on Van Gogh’s vision of art and his doomed dream of an artists’ community. Other university subjects were less than inspiring to Gittoes and he effectively dropped out before the end of first year. Undergraduate students were invited to attend the first Power Lecture in May 1968 which led the young Gittoes to meet the visiting American critic Clement Greenberg, who advised him (and other students) to travel to New York. By the end of 1968 Gittoes was in New York where he spent some time at The Art Students’ League, an open access art school. Here he worked with the African American realist artist Joseph Delaney. He also met Andy Warhol and observed the operations of The Factory.   On his return to Australia in 1969 Gittoes befriended Martin Sharp, Albie Thoms and others in their circle which included many discontented former students of East Sydney Technical College (which was a part of the state-wide institute of technical art education, with the umbrella title 'The National Art School’). In the early 1970s Australian art education, especially in New South Wales, was in flux. Universities had yet to incorporate art schools, and the TAFE sector was less than satisfactory to students who were interested in ideas as well as manufacture. Art, music, performance, food and film were experiencing a burst of creativity, but there was no formal institution to channel this energy, no official educational program to encourage new ideas. The idea of living Van Gogh’s ideal of a Yellow House where artists could be and work together came out of casual conversations and opportunities that surrounded this group of discontents. The Yellow House was established in 1970 at 59 Macleay Street Potts Point, the site of the old Terry Clune Gallery, with Martin Sharp as its prime mover. Here, for about two years, the work of an unorganised group of artists and performers became one focal point for creative activity in Australia. The aesthetic adventures of that time captured popular imagination, especially those in the media, advertising and in performance. Gittoes was a performer and the puppeteer. His magnificently decorated puppet theatre of 1971 has been recreated in the collection of the Powerhouse Museum. The puppet theatre is also recorded in Greg Weight’s Yellow House photographic portfolio, which remains the only reliable visual archive of the Spring exhibition and other events of that time. As a part of working through his ideas for performance and painting, George Gittoes began at this time to create elaborate diaries, visual, collaged and written records of art and ideas that became his daily companion. He continued this practice throughout his career, and diaries of various aspects of his career are often exhibited alongside his more formal work.   Life at the Yellow House was intense, fast moving and unsustainable, and Gittoes left towards the end of 1971. By 1972 he had moved to Bundeena, at the edge of the New South Wales Royal National Park, where he lived until 2008. The light-filled waters of Port Hacking and the patterns of the bush were woven through his art, especially his holograms of the 1970s and paintings of the 1980s. In 1972 he met some visiting Aboriginal artists from Mornington Island, temporarily based near the Park to link them with local Indigenous communities, and began working with them. Friendship and curiosity led Gittoes to explore aspects of Aboriginal sensibilities and he began making paintings, performances, holograms and a film, The Rainbow Way. Although this used abstract forms and imagery it was based in part on the great creation myth of the Rainbow Serpent. His collaborators on this project included the young art historian Gabrielle Dalton, who later became his wife, and the composer Martin Wesley-Smith. Between 1979 and 1981 these two joined with him and the late Ian Fredericks to create a series of light shows, held deep in the bush at the fresh water lagoon of Wattamolla.   By the end of the 1970s Gittoes was thinking in film. His first documentary, made for ABC TV in 1982, was Tracks of the Rainbow which followed a group of Aboriginal children from New South Wales as they travelled north to meet with tribal elders from Mornington Island. His ongoing friendships with people at Mornington Peninsula led him to what was to become his first war film on the conflict between Indigenous people and the white legal system, Warriors and Lawmen (1983). Gabrielle Dalton was producer, a position she retained for all his subsequent films. Three years later Gittoes travelled to Nicaragua to make another war film, The Bullets of the Poets. His interest here was the connection between war and poetry, and this triggered a long-term involvement with art, war and culture in conflict. An interest in visualising conflict also extended to his interest in industrial life, and the human faces behind decayed industrial sites. A painting of a soldier led to his first acceptance by the Art Gallery of New South Wales in the Sulman Prize of 1988 with El Tigre – Nicaragua. He became a regular exhibitor in the annual series of prizes awarded by the AGNSW. In 1993 Gittoes was awarded the Wynne Prize with Open Cut, a painting of a decayed Aberdare Colliery in Queensland.   The 1991 invasion of Kuwait turned Gittoes to a fresh examination of both war and how those who designated themselves to be 'peacekeepers’ would face conflict and death. His photographs of conflict in Cambodia (1992) and Somalia (1993) were commissioned by the Australian War Memorial as he recorded Australian soldiers working in United Nations’ peacekeeping activities. This led to his first success in the Blake Prize, awarded in 1992 for Ancient Prayer. He also accompanied members of the Australian Army’s Public Relations unit to Rwanda in 1995. His photographs record some of what he saw; his paintings and drawings show what could not be photographed as the United Nations soldiers tried in vain to prevent the massacres. He has described his place as an artist in this context as an 'independent witness’, an observer who is not a part of any side. This is the context for his painting The Preacher (awarded the Blake Prize in 1995), which he says he painted as a demonstration of the power of faith to both save lives and to face death with grace. In 1997 George Gittoes was awarded an AM for his services to the arts and international relations.   Gittoes’ paintings, drawings and photographs of war gave him a significant international reputation, and throughout the 1990s and into the new century he received many invitations to speak in both the USA and Germany. He was also invited to a residency at the University of Michigan. He continued his fascinations with Islamic cultures, and travelled to Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. In 2001 he was awarded a Centenary Medal 'for service as an internationally renowned artist’.   In late 2002, shortly before the US invasion of Iraq, Gittoes was in the USA to give a paper at the University of Michigan. He visited Washington where he witnessed the mass demonstrations against the future war in Iraq. The futility of these protests combined in his mind with the age of the demonstrators who tended to be older than the generation being sent to fight. He saw the need to speak to those who saw life through rapid-fire video clip images on MTV, to make art that would speak their language. This led to the creation of the documentary Soundtrack to War (2004) which was the result of two extended journeys to Baghdad. Despite having no official standing he interviewed the young US soldiers on the music they played as they burnt and bombed the city. On camera he asked about the impact of death, and recorded their responses to killing. He recorded music of the inhabitants of Baghdad as they dealt with regime change, and also the ideas and original music of the US soldiers from the African American underclass providing the bulk of the US fighting force. Soundtrack to War was shown at the Sydney and Berlin Film Festivals (2005), the Museum of Modern Art in New York (2005), Sydney’s Museum of Contemporary Art (2005) as well as being shown on cinema screens in Europe, the USA and Australia. Seventeen scenes in Soundtrack were used by Michael Moore in his Academy Award winning film, Fahrenheit 911 (2004). A second film, Rampage (2006), which examines the Miami based subculture of one group of African American soldiers whom Gittoes had met in Iraq, was shown at the Berlin, Sydney, Vancouver and Montreal film festivals in 2006 before being released in Australia, the UK, and the USA. When it was first released in Australia, Margaret Pomeranz described Rampage as “intensely human, vulnerable, and insightful” (2006). In 2007, in order to make the third film of the 'War on Terror’ trilogy Gittoes returned to the North West Frontier Province Pakistan, which he revisited in 2008 for further filming. The Miscreants of Taliwood  shows both the culture of the frontier land, and the contrast between the militant dogma of the Taliban and the spiritual traditions of Sufism. In The Miscreants of Taliwood  Gittoes argues that the Taliban have more in common with their former paymasters of the CIA than with their co-religionists. As a part of the narrative Gittoes has incorporated scenes from two comedy Pashtu language films made with local actors, using original performances of traditional tunes. This has the added advantage of circumventing copyright issues with recorded music that effectively eliminated the profits from Soundtrack to War. The burlesque of the actors is contrasted with footage of bombed shops and mosques. The Miscreants of Taliwood also includes interviews with senior figures from several aspects of the complex politics of the region. Even in its preliminary version, as screened at the 2008 Sydney Underground Film Festival under the title The Miscreants, this film was surprisingly predictive of later events in the North West Frontier and gives cultural context for the rise of the Taliban. The Miscreants of Taliwood was successfully screened at the Telluride Film Festival in 2009 in advance of cinema release.  In 2008 George Gittoes was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Letters by the University of New South Wales. His work at the time included paintings and etchings (printed by Pamela Griffith and her assistants at the Griffith workshop). This work progressed toward allegorical interpretations of the conflicts that are shaping our age, using imagery derived from art made by US soldiers in their Kuwait staging post, and the Marvel comics made to honour the 'War on Terror’. In June 2009 Gittoes participated in Creative Sydney’s 'Notes from the Underground’ at the Museum of Contemporary Art for which he recreated and updated the giant puppets from the Yellow House era, modified to include his recent concerns.   In July 2009 George Gittoes relocated to Berlin, Germany.

"
Anna Glynn,"
Multimedia Australian artist, Anna Glynn engages in painting, drawing, sculpture, writing, music, sound, installation and theatre. Her art investigates the connection to the land and the memories and stories that resonate within a place. An example of this work from her Bundanon Shoalhaven Stories series is her painting The Brave Hunter, which was selected as an iconic Australian image to feature on the front cover of A Concise History of Australia (2009) by Stuart Macintyre.
Glynn began her arts practice in the mid 1980s in Melbourne, before moving to Sydney and then to the Shoalhaven region in 1989. In 1993 she worked for 12 months with Australian artist Arthur Boyd, an experience that dramatically changed her attitude towards art and prompted the development of a new love for oil painting and printmaking. An exhibition of her paintings was held at Riversdale, part of the Bundanon Trust, at the invitation of Boyd.
Glynn’s earlier works were across a number of media including silk, sculpture and textiles. In 1988 and 1990 her work was selected for the Tamworth National Fibre Exhibition where it was collected by the gallery and formed part of a touring exhibition. In 1991 her work formed part of an international exhibition to the Kyoto Museum in Japan.
In 1995 Glynn spent the year working with rural and isolated communities, collecting stories that related to the droving routes of her Irish great grandfather. The series of paintings that resulted from this research became a touring exhibition in 1997 called 'Landscapes and Lives’ which travelled to The Australian Museum, Sydney; Dubbo Regional Gallery; Broken Hill City Art Gallery and the Mildura Arts Centre. 
She was selected for the 1996 and 1997 Outback Art Prize at Broken Hill City Art Gallery and her work was also selected for the 1997 Conrad Jupiter’s Art Prize at Gold Coast City Gallery. In 1997 she was awarded a Broken Hill City Art Gallery artist-in-residence. In 1998 Glynn received an International Women’s Day Award for her contribution to 'Women, Art & the Community’. The following year she was invited to create a work for the charity Jeans for Genes and painted images from Barbara Blackman’s Certain Chairs.
Glynn was awarded the 2000 Shoalhaven Arts Board Millennium Sculpture commission creating Shoalhaven Stories, three glazed ceramic obelisks. Her Shoalhaven Stories series began in the 1990s and reflects her lifelong interest in narrative works and in expressing the essence of place and how history and truth are created and interpreted. As part of the commission Glynn spent extensive time on research and worked with the local community to gather local stories. It was also in 2000 that Glynn was artist-in-residence at Bundanon, NSW. 
Her Strange Memories project began in 2002 when Glynn was the Parks Victoria Longridge artist-in-residence, at a spot located adjacent to her childhood family property on the Yarra River at Warrandyte. Later that year she exhibited the work at Montsalvat in Eltham, which included her original music. Glynn was then invited by the Melbourne publisher JoJo Publishing to create a book based on these works and in 2006 Strange Memories, the book of her paintings and writing, was published. Glynn also created a 65-minute artist’s film of the project as well as recording a CD of her original music and live theatre performances based on the material. In 2006 Strange Memories was selected for the Merrigong Theatre Development Program at the Illawarra Performing Arts Centre in Wollongong.
Since 2006 Glynn has travelled to China every year for exhibitions, residencies and projects focusing on cultural exchange and collaborations within Asia. In 2008 she began to develop new works that fuse Chinese traditional ink painting techniques with a Western aesthetic to create a new contemporary style. During her time in China she developed this innovative genre that utilises the natural character of the Chinese materials. 
The Australian Trade Commission invited Glynn to be part of the first Australian Pavilion at the Shanghai Art Fair in 2006 and 2007, which then led to various exhibition invitations from curators in China. Her focus from 2006 was on international exhibitions in the United States, Canada, Korea and, primarily, China, where she has developed ongoing artistic relationships with a number of Chinese curators and artists.
In 2007 Glynn represented Australia in an international art exhibition titled 'Being’ at the Zhu QiZhan Art Museum in Shanghai. The exhibition theme looked at the importance of the environment. She also presented a Strange Memories multi-media work collaborating with a local performer where narration was alternated in English and Mandarin.
Glynn’s project Parallel Dreams was based on her collaboration with contemporary Chinese artist Wu GuoWei, with whom she has continued to collaborate to extend the unique relationship between their art across their different cultures. In 2008 Glynn was awarded two artist residencies: an Australia China Council Residency to travel to Liaoning Province and another at Laughing Waters, Nillumbik, Parks Victoria, where she spent time with GuoWei. The 'Parallel Dreams’ exhibition was shown in Australia in 2010 and travelled to Peking University, Centennial Hall, Beijing in 2011.  
In 2012 her solo exhibition, 'Hidden Worlds’, was held at Harmony Space Art Gallery, Huantie Art City, Chaoyang District, Beijing, China. The exhibition was included as part of the official celebration of the 40th anniversary of Australia-China diplomatic relations. This year she also spent time developing new practical skills and undertaking research at the IARB Where Where Curatorial Collective in Beijing, China. Her area of study was new interpretations using traditional Chinese ink and wash painting techniques and exploring innovative approaches with these materials especially through video and sound.
A major retrospective of her work, ‘Shoalhaven Stories’, was held in 2012 at the Main Gallery Shoalhaven City Arts Centre. Glynn’s Shoalhaven Stories project continued in 2012 and 2013 when she was commissioned by the Shoalhaven City Council through a Your Community Heritage Program Grant from the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities to collect and express this rich historical collection. 
In 2013 she was a finalist in the Australian Art in Asia Awards for her 'Hidden Worlds’ exhibition in Beijing. This same year she was awarded an artist-in-residence in the Department of Visual Studies, Lingnan University, Hong Kong, where she undertook research and lecturing, developed new works and mounted an exhibition at the University. She was also invited to have a solo exhibition at Tsi Ku Chai Gallery, Hong Kong, and was the first foreign artist to be invited to exhibit at this gallery known for its close work with the precious cultural heritage of the Chinese nation.


"
Julie Gough,"
Working in mixed media sculpture and installation art, Julie Gough focuses on aspects of identity, its testimony, transference and displacement. Born in Melbourne in 1965 Gough is maternally descended from the Trawlwoolway people of north eastern Tasmania. Gough states “my art and research practice involves uncovering and re-presenting stories as part of an ongoing project that questions and re-evaluates the impact of the past on our present lives.” (Artist website, 2007). According to Greg Lehman, “Her work resists the temptation of offering unambiguous signifiers of her Aboriginality. Instead, Gough’s work seeks to engage the audience in a dialogue – to transform the viewer into a participant. She continually questions the mode of representations of Otherness which seduces us into a belief that we 'know’ Aborigines.” In The Oxford Companion to Aboriginal Art and Culture, writer Hannah Fink describes Gough’s work as addressing “the trauma at the heart of recent Aboriginal history, in particular of Tasmanian history … her work draws attention to some of the more outrageous chapters of Australian history and of anthropological practice.”Gough completed a BA degree in Prehistory/Anthropology at the University of Western Australia in 1986 and an interest in the correspondence of cultural heritage, identity, representation and art continues to inform much of Gough’s work. It also aligns with her employment including Interpretation Office Indigenous Culture at the Tasmanian Parks and Wildlife Service Hobart (2000-1), Lecturer in Aboriginal Studies at Riawunna, University of Tasmania, Launceston (2002-3), Curator of Indigenous Art at the National Gallery Victoria 2003-4), Lecturer in Visual Art at James Cook University Townsville (2005-6) and Guest Curator of Tayenebe at the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery Hobart (2007-8). Related work includes: Board Member Karadi Aboriginal Women’s Corporation in Berridale, Tasmania 1996; co-judging the annual Telstra National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards at the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory in 2004; co-judging the National Interpretation Awards, Australia in 2004/5/6/7; Tasmanian representative on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Arts Board of the Australia Council 2003; Board Member Umbrella Studios, Townsville 2006; AIATSIS Member (Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies) Canberra, 2008.In 1989 Gough enrolled in an Art Diploma at St Brigids TAFE, Northbridge, Perth and subsequently undertook a B.A Visual Arts degree in 1991 at Curtin University, WA. Graduating in 1993, Gough relocated to Tasmania and the School of Art in Hobart (UTAS) where she completed a Bachelor of Fine Arts Honours (First Class) degree in 1994. Gough commenced a Masters of Visual Arts Degree, again at UTAS, in 1995. An Anne and Gordon Samstag Scholarship from the University of South Australia saw Gough undertake a Masters degree in Visual Arts at Goldsmiths College, University of London in 1997 – 98. Gough then returned to UTAS to complete her PhD (Visual Arts): Transforming histories: The visual disclosure of contentious pasts in 2001. Post studies, Gough has undertaken artist residencies in Tasmania (Wilderness Residency, Arts Tasmania, 2001), New York (Greene St Studio, Australia Council for the Arts, 2002), Paris (Rosamund McCulloch Studio, Cité Internationale des Artes, 2002) and Mauritius (Mahatma Gandhi Institute, volunteer sculpture lecturer, Moka, Commonwealth Arts and Craft Award, 2001-2)Gough’s first major exhibiting opportunity was 'Perspecta 1995’, curated by Judy Annear, at the Art Gallery of New South Wales. The work Medical Series, subsequently acquired by the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, investigated the supposed physical markers of race. That same year Gabrielle Pizzi invited Gough to exhibit in Melbourne for the first time in the exhibition 'New Voices – New Directions’. Since that initial group exhibition Gough has held solo exhibitions at Gallery Gabrielle Pizzi on five occasions: 'Heartland’, 2001, 'Re-collection’, 1997, 'Dark Secrets/Home Truths’, 1996, 'Intertidal’, 2005 and 'Musselroe Bay’, 2007. Since 1994 Julie Gough has exhibited in over 80 exhibitions nationally and internationally. The inaugural Liverpool Biennale, UK 'Trace’, 1999, curated by Tony Bond (AGNSW) was Gough’s first overseas exhibiting experience. The process of uncovering lives of Liverpool’s 18th and 19th century orphan children for the work home SWEET home encouraged Gough’s ongoing exploration of histories locally rendered indistinct. In 2003 Gough exhibited Transmutation in Outside Inside: Fragments of Place at Brigham Young University in Utah, USA, where she represented the experience of alienation in time, place, culture by staging an otherworldly abduction scene. In 2006 Gough exhibited in the Tamworth Textile Biennale and the Biennale of Sydney. Both resulting artworks, Navigator and Locus, were representations of canoe-crafts as metaphors for the impossible desire to return through time and space to an earlier, pre-colonial Tasmania. In 2005 and 2006, while located in Townsville, increasing exhibition opportunities converged with the award of an Australia Council for the Arts Fellowship, and two State Library Fellowships (Tasmania and Victoria). These precipitated travel, research, artist residencies and exhibitions around Australia from early 2006 through 2008 and enabled Gough’s return to live in Tasmania. In 2007 and 2008 Gough held solo exhibitions at venues outside of Melbourne for the first time: 'The Ranger’ at the South Australian School of Art Gallery, 'Interrupted – Renditions of unresolved accounts’ at Turner Galleries, Perth, and, 'Fugitive History’ at Bett Gallery, Hobart. Key group exhibitions in 2007 were 'Power and Beauty: Indigenous Art Now’, Heide Museum of Modern Art, Victoria, 'An Other Place’, Long Gallery, Salamanca Arts Centre, Hobart, and, 'Thresholds of Tolerance’, ANU School of Art Gallery, Canberra.Gough also writes and speaks about art and identity and in 2007 “We walked on a carpet of stars” a film on Gough’s art practice was launched by Creative Cowboy films in Melbourne.Gough’s work is represented in the collections in a number of state and national collections around Australia.

Elaine Alys Haxton,"
painter, printmaker, designer and commercial artist, was born in Newmarket, Melbourne, on 26 September 1909, youngest of the three children of David Haxton, a stationery salesman and a talented amateur painter of Scottish descent, and Isobel, née Durham. She came to Sydney with her family as an infant. After leaving school at fourteen, she spent a year studying drawing and sculpture full-time with Rayner Hoff. In 1924-28 she studied at East Sydney Technical College and from 1925 also worked commercially, first in a city factory decorating pokerwork vases and breadboards with kookaburras and waratahs, then as a 'fashion artist’ at David Jones’s department store illustrating advertisements {acc.Thomas}.
In 1929 she set up as a freelance designer and illustrator with four other advertising illustrators in a Bridge Street studio, continuing until 1931. She was also invited to join a sketch club run by Alison Rehfisch and George Duncan .
She went to London in 1932, as soon as she’d saved her fare, and worked full-time with J.Walter Thompson for three years. Then she remained on a retainer while also working for Harper’s Bazaar , Vogue and Strand Magazine . In the evenings she studied at the Grosvenor School under Iain McNab. She designed playing cards for the P&O Line amid other freelance commercial art commissions, and she also exhibited oil paintings in London (ROI 1937).
With the impending outbreak of World War II Haxton returned to Australia via the US and Mexico in 1939. In Mexico she became interested in architectural decoration.
After her return she became especially friendly with Tas (Russell) and Bonnie Drysdale . When the Drysdales moved to Albury in 1941, Haxton often worked in a nearby studio-barn with Tas and with Donald Friend who was stationed with the army at nearby Pukapunyal.
Back at Sydney she exhibited paintings {mainly at the Macquarie Galleries}. She began painting murals in restaurants and for the large stateroom of a visiting British aircraft carrier. She worked with Alistair Morrison on a vast mural for the entrance of the Great Hall at the Royal Easter Show c.1942. Her mural for Le Coq d’Or restaurant won the Sulman Prize in 1943. In 1944-45 she was director, stage manager and scene painter for a small company entertaining the troops in New Guinea.
During the war she also illustrated stories in Australia: National Journal and Australia Week-end Book . Vol. 1 (1942) of the latter contains her 'Mrs Tabbie’s Teaparty’ (a drawing quite unrelated to the accompanying poem, 'The Cat’); a fat lady eating eclairs in restaurant for 'Eclair’ by Jean Stanger; 'Georgie sat in the sun, shelling peas for lunch’ for 'Mail Day’ by Alison McDougall (p.102), and circus man yelling 'Ark’ beside lizards for Roger Welch’s 'Lizards Aloft’ (p.193) – the best of them. Most are signed 'Elaine’. She is also represented in vol.2 (1943), p.56; vol.3 (1944) has a small illustration; vol.4 (1945) decorations.
At the end of 1945 she went to New York where she later studied stage design at the summer school of the NY Theatre. She spent 8 months in London and several months touring Europe before returning to Australia in 1949. She spent the next 12 years in Australia mainly occupied with stage design but also involved in advertising, book illustration, painting, print-making and set and costume design for ballet and opera. (She also designed furnishing textiles for Marion Hall Best and Claudio Alcorso.) She travelled widely, notably as one of the members of the Australian Cultural Delegation visiting China in 1956.
In her later years she devoted most of her time to painting and printmaking. She studied the latter at Joyce Ewart 's Willoughby Art Centre in Sydneyin 1965, where she was taught various techniques by Elizabeth Rooney and became especially interested in etching. Her long-time interest in Japanese culture took her to Japan in 1961. In 1969 she spent three months at Hayter’s Atelier 17 in Paris, then revisited Japan later that year to study woodcut printing techniques in Kyoto. Her prints include Ju-Jitsu 1981 (2 figures in b/w, quite lively), TMAG edn 6/20 (#3532).
In 1986 she was awarded the AM 'particularly for printmaking’. After a long illness {dementia} – she was cared for by her niece and husband in Adelaide from 1989 – Haxton died in Adelaide on 6 July 1999, aged 89. She was predeceased by her husband, Brigadier Richard Foot, whose third wife she had become in 1954.
She is well represented in state and regional public collections throughout Australia. Didn’t approve of women’s art exhibitions; 'In 1982 she told Barbara Chapman, “I want to be judged by all my peers, not half of them”.

Joy Hester,"
painter, was born in Elsternwick, Victoria. She attended St Michael’s Church of England Girls’ Grammar School in 1933-35 before commencing one year of a commercial art course at Brighton Technical School. She started in the Drawing School of the National Gallery School in 1937 and completed one and a half years, leaving in mid-1938 despite winning a prize for drawing the head from life at the annual students’ exhibition. In 1937 she met the painter Albert Tucker whom she was to marry in 1941; in 1945 they had a son, Sweeney.
During the period 1937-42 she met and became friendly with several artists who are now recognised as the most significant of their generation: Sidney Nolan, Danila Vassilieff, Josl Bergner , Noel Counihan , Arthur Boyd and John Perceval . She was also associated with John Reid and his wife, Sunday, whose home at Heidelberg, Heide, became a centre for many of these artists (c.1940-47).
In 1947 Joy Hester was diagnosed as having Hodgkins’s disease, a malignant cancer of the lymph glands. She moved to Sydney with Gray Smith, leaving Tucker and her son in Melbourne. She married Gray Smith in 1959; there were two children, Peregrine and Fern, from her second marriage.
In her lifetime, Hester had three solo exhibitions: in 1950, 1953 and 1956. She was a foundation member of the Contemporary Art Society and exhibited many times in its annual shows. After returning to Melbourne in 1948, she lived in the semi-rural countryside around Melbourne, at Hurstbridge, Avonsleigh and Upwey, before moving to Box Hill in 1956 where she had her own studio for the first time.
Joy Hester produced a large body of drawings in the period 1939-58. She rarely used oils; instead, from early in her career, she devoted herself to using ink and Chinese brushwork to create her expressionistic, personal images. Her subjects were those of personality and intimacy; faces, lovers and relationships between people were the basis and inspiration of her art. Joy Hester died in 1960 after fighting the disease for 13 years.


"
Nora Heysen,"
painter, was born on 11 January 1911 at Hahndorf, a village in the Adelaide Hills, South Australia. The fourth of eight children she received her earliest art training from her father, the painter Hans Heysen . Her mother Selma, also a talented artist, encouraged her daughter in her artistic pursuits. Their home, The Cedars, situated in a delightful rural setting, provided the ideal environment for a large family. Nora spent her early years accompanying her father bicycling around Hahndorf on painting expeditions. From the age of 15 she spent five years at the School of Fine Arts in North Adelaide. Her training, under F. Millward Grey , was traditional: drawing from plaster casts for several years before starting life classes. She also continued to draw with her father, which provided a freer perspective.
In 1930, while still a student, she did 24 pen, ink and wash drawings to illustrate Woggheeguy , a collection of Dreamtime legends by Katie Langloh Parker (Catherine Stow); the originals are in the NLA (National Library of Australia, Canberra). She exhibited with the Society of Artists in Sydney the same year and the trustees of the Art Galleries of New South Wales and South Australia purchased her work. With the sale of her first picture she converted the stables at her parents’ property into a studio so she no longer had to share her father’s. She was also able to pay a regular model, a local girl from Hahndorf, resulting in several portraits of 'Ruth’. She had her first solo exhibition with the Royal SA Society of Artists in 1933, aged 22.
In 1934 she accompanied her family to England, remaining there after they returned in order to study under Bernard Meninsky at the Central School of Art. The arrival of her sculptor friend Everton (Evie) Stoke from Adelaide in 1935 provided an opportunity to share expeditions and experiences. The same year Orovida Pissarro introduced Heysen to her father, Lucien Pissarro, who encouraged her to make her colours purer, and she visited Paris. In 1936 she enrolled at the Byam Shaw School under Ernest Jackson. The following year she travelled to Italy before returning home. At once realising her need for independence, Heysen moved to Sydney where Sidney Ure Smith assisted her to become a member of the Society of Artists. The following year, she became the first woman to be awarded the prestigious Archibald Prize for her portrait of Madame Elink Schuurman. This brought commissions and recognition and gave her confidence in herself as an artist. In 1943 she was the first woman to be appointed an official war artist. Sent to New Guinea, she met Dr Robert Black whom she joined after the war in London where he was involved in specialist study of tropical medicine. They married at Sydney in 1953 and the following year purchased The Chalet in Hunters Hill, her first permanent home since The Cedars. They travelled to tropical regions and Heysen returned to New Guinea and resumed an earlier fascination: painting the local people.
Heysen’s father died in 1968 and her marriage ended several years later. She had her first retrospective exhibition in 1984 at the Old Clarendon Gallery (South Australia) and another in 1989 at the National Trust S.H. Ervin Gallery, Sydney. In 1994 she attended the opening of 'Through Women’s Eyes’ (Australian War Memorial, Canberra, ACT) and saw work she had painted 50 years earlier. Heysen died in Sydney on 30 December 2003.

Jacqueline Hick,"
painter, was born in Adelaide and has had a long and distinguished career in South Australia. She was educated at the Girls’ Central Art School, the SA School of Arts and Crafts (1934-37) and Adelaide Teachers’ College (1939-40). She taught at the School of Arts and Crafts in 1941-45, then resigned to work full time as an artist. Her most influential teachers were Mary P. Harris and John Goodchild (husband of Doreen ). She was also influenced by the professionalism of Dorrit Black , although not by Black’s style. In 1952 she married Frank Galazowski; they have four children.
Jacqueline Hick is primarily a figure painter in oils although she has also made prints, set designs and enamels. Her approach to media is to learn traditional methods thoroughly and then to experiment. In the early 1940s she, Thelma Fisher and Christine Miller learnt print-making from John Goodchild, then produced intaglio prints using unconventional methods. Although necessitated by a shortage of materials due to the war, this has become Jacqueline Hick’s method. In 1951 she took lessons in the use of oil glazes from Ivor Hele and subsequently used it almost in the manner of watercolour painting, particularly in her underwater bathers’ paintings of the 1970s.
Jacqueline Hick’s approach to subject matter and style is similar. She is conscious of working in the European tradition, which she studied in England, France and Italy (1948-50); she has been inspired by the work of Goya, Daumier, Kollwitz and, in Australia, Dobell and Drysdale. Her subject matter can be divided into two: a vein of social comment ranging from mild satire to trenchant criticism and more decorative work based on the Australian landscape and its fauna and flora. The former evokes wartime life in Adelaide, family life during the 1950s, the dispossession of the Australian Aborigines, the oppressive nature of the city, portraits of family and friends and the expression of her love of the performing arts. In her decorative work she enjoys the challenge of combining aesthetic needs and an awareness based on informed observation. Her hobbies are the study of geology and ornithology, and she has been a member of the Field Geology Club of South Australia and the Queensland Ornithology Society.
Throughout her career Jacqueline Hick has been active in arts organisations. She was a founder committee member of the Contemporary Art Society (SA), a founder member of the Adelaide Theatre Group, a member of the Royal SA Society of Arts, a Board member of the Art Gallery of SA (1968-75) and a member of the first Council of the Australian National Gallery (1982-85, now NGA).
Jacqueline Hick has mostly worked in Adelaide but lived in Brisbane in 1978-90. She now lives in retirement in Adelaide. She has won many awards for her painting, principally the Melrose Prize (1959) for her Self Portrait , the Cornell Prize (1958, 1960) and the Maude Vizard-Wholohan Prize (1962, 1964). In 1995 Hick was appointed Member of the Order of Australia, AM, for services to art.

Adrienne Higgs,
Frank Hodgkinson,"
painter, illustrator and cartoonist, was born in Sydney. He began painting aged 14 when a student at Fort Street Boys High. He left school at the age of 16 and was briefly apprenticed to a lithographer, then worked as a commercial artist for a short time and later freelanced as an illustrator. In the 1930s while working fulltime, including being a cartoonist on the Sydney Daily Telegraph , he studied at the Royal Art Society School with Sydney Long and Dattilo Rubbo , following the latter when he set up the Dattilo Rubbo Atelier. He had not long completed his studies and was working in Melbourne as a press artist on the Herald in 1939 when WWII broke out. He joined up and served with the Australian Imperial Force in North Africa, Syria and New Guinea in 1940-46, being mentioned in despatches for conspicuous gallantry on the Owen Stanley Ranges.
Cartoons drawn in Palestine include the series A Design for Living 1941: 'Palestine is a man’s country – the “Wog” may be primitive but he has the right slant on domestic bliss’ (Arab on a donkey followed by his wives and children on foot bearing loads and observed by two Diggers)/ 'Why not introduce a new order on our return’ (man on bike followed by laden wife, baby in billycart and two kids)/ 'If it works maybe we’d even get away with this (husband going into pub leaving laden wife outside, “I won’t be half an hour dear!”/ Well I did say MAYBE!’), brush and ink with blue wash over pencil, 53.4 × 42.8 cm, published Active Service (original AWM 1941, p.97 – AWM Acc. No. I 630, cat.62, transferred from Private Records Collection 1985).
He was appointed a captain and official war artist and sent to Borneo, where he drew and painted the Allies’ assault landings at Balikpapan, which deeply affected him. After the war he went to London, 'and then on to Paris and Rome and to Madrid, where I studied in each place, not formally in any particular school but rather under my own steam’ (Hazel de Burgh coll, NLA, quoted McDonald). He did undertake short periods of study under Bernard Meninsky at the Central School of Art and Craft in London and also at the Académie Grand Chaumière in Paris, returning to London from time to time to support his study with freelance illustration. He also took lessons in printmaking at S.W. Hayter’s renowned Atelier 17 in Paris.
Returning to Sydney after six years in Europe, Hodgkinson made abstract etchings, printed by Strom Gould , e.g. Tauromaquia 1953, strongly influenced by the modern Spanish art he had seen – works by Canogar, Cela, Suarez, Tapies et al. He returned to Spain to live in 1958 after winning the inaugural Helena Rubenstein Travelling Scholarship. From then on his art became more abstract and expressionist. He lived in the USA (1961-2), Spain again (1963-67) then Italy (1967-69). He was exhibited as a Spanish artist in both Spain and at the Tate Gallery, London; in 1964, Colin Jack-Hinton notes, the Spanish critic Arean described him as 'one of the most rigorous and authentic painters of the time’ and 'a foreigner who more than most understands the spirit, gallantry and elegance of Spain’. Nevertheless, he regularly visited Australia throughout the 1960s, where he also exhibited his work, and in 1970 became keen on rediscovering the Australian landscape and returned home permanently.
He lived in Cairns for a few months in 1971 until invited by his friend Clifton Pugh to join him at 'Dunmoochin’, Pugh’s property at Cottles Bridge outside Melbourne. Fellow artists working there included John Olsen, whom Hodge had got to know well in Spain, Fred Williams and Albert Tucker . Stimulated by Pugh and his more recent study with Hayter’s oil viscosity process Hodginson produced two series of prints, Inside the Landscape and Landscape Inside (both 1971) – figurative images that are 'a joyous celebration of female and landscape forms’ (Butler), which broke new ground in colour and texture printing (McD). He and Pugh produced IS , a book of prints with poems by Harry Roschenko, one of the first artist collaborations in Australia, acc. McDonald.
In 1976 Hodgkinson married Kate Ratten whom he had met at Pugh’s and they moved to the then bush at Kenthurst, outside Sydney; their daughter Zoe was born c.1980. They built a home and studio set over a precipitous gorge in 'magnificent land’. Hodge remained there for the rest of his life, apart from being artist-in-residence at the National Art School, Papua New Guinea in 1977 (resulting in Sepik Diary , 1982) and at the University of Melbourne in 1979. From 1978 to 1987 he made more or less annual trips to the Northern Territory, leading to several exhibitions (his first Arnhem Land exhibition was held in 1979), the publication of Kakadu and the Arnhem Land (1987), and, with Colin Jack-Hinton, setting up the 'artists-in-the-field’ program sponsored by the (then) Museums and Art Galleries of the Northern Territory. He died at home on 20 October 2001.
Hodge worked with his friend Max Miller on many of later prints, most published by Port Jackson Press. The Melbourne Savage Club has examples of his work, according to Dow, evidently donated by his brother Roy Hodgkinson , a longtime active member. From the late 1990s Roger Butler was instrumental in acquiring much of his large personal archive of prints, sketchbooks and drawings for the NGA.

Quentin Hole,"
Robert Quentin Hole was born in Charleville, Queensland on 6 May 1923. Nothing is known of his early years or education but he enlisted in the Australian Army in 1945 so that when he was discharged a year later he was able to study art (under Melville Haysom at the Central Technical College, Brisbane under the terms Commonwealth Rehabilitation Scheme from 1947 to 1949). He was a member of the Younger Artists Group of the Royal Queensland Art Society and exhibited with the parent group in 1949 and 1951. He held an exhibition with his friend Don Cowen in Brisbane in 1950 before they travelled to North Queensland where they held a further exhibition of their works in Cairns.
Hole was clearly regarded as a promising young artist as his work was included in the 'Exhibition of Queensland Art’, held at the Queensland Art Gallery in 1951 (Queensland’s response to the 'Commonwealth Jubilee Exhibition’ as so few Queenslanders were included in the official selection) and also in the first exhibition of 'Queensland Artists of Fame and Promise’ in 1952. He received a considerable profile for his involvement with Cowen in the production of a series of murals in the Old Geology Museum at the University of Queensland ( The Courier-Mail , 1952). The first mural depicts The Age of Reptiles (1951) in a narrow panoramic strip of some 15 metres in length. Their The Age of Mammals (1952) is considerably smaller. In 1958 Hole was commissioned to complete the series with a depiction of the enormous marine reptile Kronosaurus queenslandicus in The King of the Sea (the story of the mural is told by Dr Kerry Heckenberg in Queensland Historical Atlas ).
His early exhibition career in Queensland was largely held with Brian and Marjorie Johnstone firstly in conjunction with Don Cowen at the Marodian Gallery and in a 'Christmas Exhibition’ in 1951. When the gallery changed its premises and became the Johnstone Gallery he contributed to its second exhibition of painting and exhibitions in 1952 before having a 'Farewell exhibition’ in 1953 in which the critic, Ernest Briggs, praised Hole’s “two different styles” ( The Courier-Mail , 1953) before he departed on the 'Moreton Bay’ for London with Cowen a few days later. His paintings are largely landscape with a focus, common at the time, on the derelict inner suburb of Spring Hill.
Hole studied under Hans Tisdall, Patrick Heron and Victor Passmore at the Central School of Arts and Crafts London from 1954 to 1956. At this time he sent an exhibition entitled 'Paintings from abroad’ to the Johnstone Gallery in 1954 which evinced measured praise from Dr Gertrude Langer ( The Courier-Mail , 1954) and on his return in 1956 held another solo exhibition. After being included in the 1957 'Exhibition of Queensland Art’ with other promising younger artists such as Jon Molvig and Margaret Olley he disappears from the exhibition scene in Queensland.
Hole had already begun his involvement with theatre before he departed Brisbane in a Twelfth Night Theatre production of Jean Anouhil’s Ring Round The Moon . When he returned to Australia he worked as a painter and theatre designer, first with the Twelfth Night Theatre in Brisbane being involved with company’s 1962 production of Aristophanes’ Lysistrata , the Union Repertory Theatre, Melbourne University, and subsequently with the Elizabethan Trust Opera Company when he designed costumes for the productions of Gilbert and Sullivan’s operettas HMS Pinafore and Iolanthe in 1969.
He then moved to Sydney where he worked in television productions including as designer for the ABC’s production of Daisy Bates 1863-1951: Our first saint in 1972 and subsequently: Seven little Australians (1973); Ride on Stranger (1979); Big Toys (1980); The Coral Island (1983); A Halo for Athuan (1984); Boy in the Bush (1984); Naked under Capricorn (1989); and The private War of Lucinda Smith (1990). He designed costumes for Great Expectations, the Untold Story (1986) and was art director for No Room to Run (1978).
Hole’s early penchant for illustration in his murals found ideal expression when he provided illustrations to Banjo Paterson’s poems The man from Ironbark (1974) which won the 1975 Children’s Book Council of Australia Picture Book of the Year Award and A bush christening (1976). In 1981 he wrote and illustrated a children’s book How to demolish a monster which was set in North Queensland and Dancing Phoebe and the Famous Mumblegum Piano (1987).


"
Gordon Hookey,"
Waanyi artist, Gordon Hookey was born on the 2nd February 1961 in Cloncurry, Queensland. Hookey says he began painting in Grade One and has remained an artist ever since. Hookey worked as a labourer before moving to Sydney in the late 1980s to enrol in a Bachelor of Fine Arts at the College of Fine Arts, University of NSW. Whilst at COFA Hookey became an artist member of Boomalli Aboriginal Artist Cooperative, then located in the inner city suburb of Redfern. He completed his degree in 1992. Hookey’s early paintings addressed many of the past injustices inflicted upon Aboriginal people. According to Dr Joseph Pugliese who wrote about Hookey for the 2004 Sydney Biennale catalogue, 'Reason and Emotion’, his style “cuts across generic boundaries and aesthetic styles – where the conventions of history painting, protest art, cartoons, pop art, graffiti, surrealism and mural art converge on a single canvas.”  Hookey began exhibiting immediately upon graduation and in 1993 he exhibited his work in 'Dante in Australia’ at the Centro Deantesco in Ravenna, Italy. In 1995 he exhibited in 'Native Title’, at Tandanya Aboriginal Cultural Centre in Adelaide. Hookey’s reputation as a political artist began to grow from 1996 and the increasing appreciation and respect within the Aboriginal arts community for his work was confirmed in 1997 when festival producer Rhoda Roberts invited Hookey to participate in 'Off-Shore, On-Site’ for the 'Festival of the Dreaming’ – the first Cultural Olympiad for the 2000 Sydney Olympics. 'Off-Shore, On-Site’ was a group residency and exhibition of international Indigenous artists hosted by Casula Powerhouse Arts Centre in South Western Sydney. Casula Powerhouse subsequently commissioned him, along with New Zealand based Samoan artist Andy Leilei, to participate in a 1998 residency and exhibition titled 'Furious’ which was part of the 2nd Pacific Wave Festival. Hookey’s works King Hit (for Queen and Country); Brick Shithouse and Ten Point Scam were included in the 2000 Adelaide Biennale exhibition 'Beyond the Pale’, which was curated by Brenda L Croft included and it was at this time that Hookey’s practice began to gain notoriety and the attention of the print media. Bruce James, art critic for the Sydney Morning Herald declared of Hookey’s work in 'Beyond the Pale’ on the11th March 2000, that he “wanted the Queen of Australia just as I want John Howard, her Prime Minister, to see Hookey’s scalding canvases and constructions, the sting in the tail of the show.” Hookey’s 2003 work Sacred Nation, scared nation, indoctrination was included in the National Gallery of Victoria’s exhibition, 'Colour Power’, that opened at the Ian Potter Centre in Federation Square in November, 2004. This large three-panel piece speaks, among other things, of the wanton destruction of pristine environments by the government of the United States of America in its search for oil and of the Australian government’s complicity in such behaviour. This work, when first acquired and displayed in 2004 by the NGV, was the subject of much discussion in the local Melbourne tabloid press, which led to the then Victorian Liberal Opposition Arts Spokesman, Mr Andrew Olexander calling for its removal from display.  2004 Sydney Biennale curator Isabel Carlos included Hookey’s 2004 work, Paranoia Annoy Ya in this international event. A large installation piece, it was shown at the Museum of Contemporary Art and participating in the biennale afforded Hookey an audience he never had before. In 2005 Hookey showcased his new exhibition, 'www.gordonhoo.com’ at the gallery of his new dealer, Nellie Castan in Melbourne and in 2007 Brisbane gallery Bellas Milani Gallery began to represent him also.  In 2006 Hookey had three arts residencies – one for the Otago University, Dunedin, New Zealand, one at Melbourne’s Gertrude Street Contemporary Art Space and the third at the Banff Centre in Canada. The Canadian residency was partly funded through the Australia Council for the Arts. 2007 saw Hookey participate in the National Gallery of Australia’s 1st National Indigenous Art Triennal, 'Culture Warriors’ curated by Brenda Croft. Hookey continues to create work that responds to the national events and policies that affect Aboriginal people and since 2001 his work has begun to comment increasingly on international events such as 'The War on Terror’ and global warming.  Even though Hookey returned to live in Queensland in 2002, he remains a member of Boomalli Aboriginal Artists Cooperative and in 2006 he became an active member of the Brisbane-based Aboriginal arts group, ProppaNOW. Other Brisbane artists involved with ProppaNOW include, Richard Bell, Laurie Nilson, Jennifer Herd, Bianca Beetson and Vernon Ah Kee.

Glenn Iseger-Pilkington,"
Yamatji/Nyoongar artist Glenn Pilkington was born in Perth, Western Australia, in 1981. He spent most of his childhood in the Kimberley region before his family moved to Bunbury in 1994. He moved back to Perth in 2000 and began developing his art practice soon after. In 2008 he completed a Bachelor of Fine Arts at Edith Cowan University, majoring in Printmaking.The contrast between his childhood in remote country in the north of the state, and the urban environment of Perth is a foundational concern for Pilkington. His work derives from his reflections upon the impact of this social and environmental transition upon his subjectivity as an Indigenous Australian. He writes:“Coming from strong Aboriginal and European heritage, my work explores displacement in both the emotional and physical context, loss of connections to both places and people in an attempt to place myself as an individual… Through the investigation of spaces and places, both natural and urban, my work explores the connection with country that I feel as an Aboriginal Australian living and working within an urban environment. The aesthetic of my work represents the peace I have trained myself to feel in the urban world in direct contrast to the years I have spent in 'traditional country’.” (artist’s statement, Mossenson Galleries 2006).
Working predominantly in photomedia, Pilkington makes use of third generation digital technology to create images of urban environments which are then subjected to a studio-based digital editing process. This process usually involves the erosion of recognisable content to varying degrees, so that an abstracted pictorial structure emerges. Pilkington’s editing often obscures the spatial logic of the original scene such that aspects of the imagery are fragmented, mirrored and repeated. The urban settings are thereby transformed into shapes, vectors and planes that find an aesthetic harmony through symmetry and geometric patterning, or by centering points of curiosity that may have been marginal in the original image.
These processes are underpinned by Pilkington’s explorations of the experience of travelling between the country and the city, tracing the passing of time, finding the familiar in the foreign, and sensing emotive resonances within spaces that echo places or moments from the past. Sarah Jane Pell, writing in the Xstrata Coal Emerging Indigenous Art Award 2008 Catalogue, suggests that “by using digital editing to re-present the urban terrain as an abstract topography, Pilkington emulates and respects his traditional relationship to country”.
Pilkington has exhibited throughout Australia since 2006. He was a finalist in the Ergon Energy Central Queensland Art Award (2006), the Hutchins Art Prize (2007) and the Sunshine Coast Art Prize (2007). In 2007 he won The Linden Award, which is part of the Melbourne Fringe Festival, and in 2008 he was shortlisted for both the Telstra National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award and the Xstrata Coal Emerging Indigenous Art Award. Exhibitions have included the solo show 'Urban Country’ at Mossenson Galleries in Melbourne (2007), ’30 Under 30: A New Generation of Indigenous Artists’ which was shown at Mossenson Galleries in Melbourne and Perth (2008), and 'Innovators 3’ at the Linden Centre for Contemporary Art in Melbourne (2008).

"
Jeanette James,"
Born in Launceston in 1952, shell necklace stringer, Jeanette James, collected shells with her sister for their mother, Corrie Fullard , since early childhood. From 1961 to 1967 the two sisters would help their mother make shell ornaments that were sold at a local shop. Though she had been working with shells all her life, she did not create her first necklace until she attended a 1989 workshop at Orford on the east coast of Tasmania. Nor did she exhibit in any major exhibition until she was accepted as a finalist with her work, kanalaritja (mariner shell necklace) in the Telstra National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award in 2000; she went on to won the 3D category of this award. In 2007 another of her necklaces, Trimanya was short-listed for that year’s Telstra awards and was acquired by the Queensland Art Gallery.Her necklaces continue the tradition of Tasmanian Aboriginal women who, says James in her artist statement, “crafted these beautiful necklaces to wear on special occasions and to trade with other tribes for items such as ochre and tools.” James and her mother travel widely around the coastlines of Tasmania, including the islands of Bass Strait, collecting shells which are then cleaned in readiness for necklace creating. This collecting and cleaning process may sometimes take up to eight months. The shells that both these women favour are the mariner (sometimes spelt marineer), blackcrows, oats, rice, toothies, gulls and penguins.James has exhibited her work in a number of exhibitions including the group show “Singular & Multiple: New jewellery from Tasmania”, curated by Kate Rhodes and Brian Parkes and held at the Henry Jones Art Hotel in Hobart in 2007. Also that year she exhibited with her mother in the exhibition “Corrie Fullard & Jeanette James” at the Bett Gallery in Hobart. In 2008 she participated in the group show “Island of Inspiration: new jewellery from Tasmania” with Indigenous and non-Indigenous jewellers including her aunt Dulcie Greeno, at Metalab in Surry Hills, Sydney.Her work is held in the permanent collections of the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery, Launceston; the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory, Darwin; the Lake Macquarie City Art Gallery, Speers Point, New South Wales; the Art Gallery of South Australia and the Queensland Art Gallery.
In 2008 she was living and working in Hobart, Tasmania. At this time she also sat on the board of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Arts Board of the Australia Council for the Arts.

Tim Johnson,"
CHECK CONFIRM COLLABORATIONS
Painter, a son of Peter Johnson, former professor of architecture at Sydney University, chancellor UTS and name partner in the firm of McConnell, Smith and Johnson; his brother is Chris Johnson, NSW Government Architect since the late 1990s. Tim Johnson was an early and major collector of Western Desert Aboriginal art from the 1970s when he was married to the writer and historian of Aboriginal Art, Dr Vivien Johnson. He first studied architecture but turned to art under the influence of the experimental culture surrounding what later became Sydney University’s Tin Sheds. He taught for some time at Kogarah Girls High School in Sydney’s working class south. His early exhibited works of art were transgressive experimental films and photographs. Later he turned to painting and his most successful early works were his 1987 collaborations with Kaapa (Mbitjana) Tjampitjinpa (c.1926-1989) and others (including possibly Michael Nelson Jagamara) some of which were exhibited in one of the Sydney Biennales. 
There is some speculation that the National Portrait Gallery in Canberra also commissioned a work from him.

Jonathan Jones,"
Jonathan Jones spent his early years living with family members in Sydney, Bathurst and a small town near Tamworth. The greatest influence in his fragmented childhood was his grandmother, a Wiradjuri woman from Bathurst who encouraged him to be proud of his Aboriginal heritage. After dropping out of school he enrolled at TAFE and then spent a short time enrolled at the College of Fine Arts, University of NSW.The Boomalli Aboriginal artists’ cooperative gave him the opportunity to work as a curator, and this evolved into a career at the Art Gallery of NSW, first in public programs and then as assistant curator of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art. In recent years he has worked closely with remote Aboriginal communities in central Australia.While he was working at Boomalli, Jones began to experiment with materials, including making photograms from Vegemite. He became fascinated with corrugated iron and fencing wire, triggered by family stories of his great-grandfather who was a fencer, and lines of wire became lines of light.Jones first came to critical attention with his works made from straight beams of light, and the way he loaded them with multiple meanings. As his work has matured he has become interested in the truths behind the many layers of history that cover the land. This is reflected in his most recent commission, the Kaldor Your great idea project which will take place in 2016

Deborah Kelly,"
Artist Deborah Kelly was born in Melbourne in 1962. She began making socially engaged artwork in 1983 and has exhibited across Australia and internationally.
Earlier in her career Kelly worked as a cartoonist; in 1985 she was represented in ‘The Heidelberg School Picnic’, the State Library of Victoria exhibition of the work of contemporary Australian cartoonists. In 1991 she participated in ‘Out of Line’ with Jane Cafarella, Trudy Clutterbok, Kaz Cooke , Bronwyn Halls, Judy Horacek , Kathleen McCann, Nicole McKinnon, Joan Rosser and Jo Waite . Her cartooning work was primarily made for print media rather than exhibition and was published extensively around Australia from 1981 to 1988.
The media through which she worked became increasingly varied after 1989. Her photomedia project Hey, hetero! (2001), created in collaboration with Tina Fiveash , has been displayed on bus shelters, billboards, screens, magazines, newspapers, and text books in Sydney, Melbourne, Wellington, Glasgow, Berlin, Minneapolis and Claremont.  Her 2009 work Tank Man Tango: a Tiananmen Memorial was a distributed dancing memorial for the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre and was performed in over 20 cities and towns around the world.
At the 2008 Singapore Biennale, her work involved projections onto clouds over the city; this was a reiteration of her Museum of Contemporary Art commissioned work, Beware of the God , first shown in 2005. Her work for the Sydney Biennale in 2014 was a large collaborative collage work 'No Human being is Illegal’.
Kelly is a founding member of boat-people.org, a group of Sydney-based art and media workers who collaborate on public work about issues of race, history and borders.
Kelly also began creating gallery-based artworks in 1988 and continued this practice in parallel to her public work.  Her solo shows since 2007 have featured collage, video and installation work.
Deborah Kelly sometimes curates in collaboration with people and institutions. Major curatorial projects include BORDERPANIC with Zina Kaye at Performance Space, Sydney, in 2002; Terra Nullius at Galerie ACC in Weimar and Halle 14 in Leipzig with Frank Motz in 2009; and SEXES at Carriageworks Sydney with Bec Dean and Jeff Khan in 2012.
Kelly lives and works in Sydney and Melbourne..


"
Roger Kemp,"
Roger Kemp, painter and etcher, was born in July 1908 in Bendigo, Victoria, second child of Frank Kemp, who worked at a nearby gold mine, and his mother Rebecca Kemp (née Harvey). The family relocated to the Melbourne suburb of South Yarra in 1913 after Roger Kemp’s father was seriously injured in a mining accident.
In 1929, Roger Kemp enrolled in drawing classes at the National Gallery Art School where he studied alongside fellow artists including John Vickery and Noel Counihan. During 1930-32 he attended the School’s night classes and in 1932 he enrolled in the Working Men’s College (now RMIT). Roger Kemp returned to the National Gallery School in 1933 where he studied for the next three years accompanied by students such as Clifford Bayliss, Nancy Grant and Ian MacFarlane. At the same time, Roger Kemp was largely self-taught, developing his own innovative artistic vision and becoming one of the key figures of abstract art in Australia. 
Kemp’s early works of the 1930s were small in scale, figural, reflected the influence of Cézanne and were inspired by the idea of analogy between art and music. His later works drew upon both geometric abstraction and abstract expressionism and were thus composed of considered lines creating geometric shapes as well as expressive, impulsive brushstrokes. After an extended period of time working away from the public eye, Kemp held his first solo exhibition in 1945 at Velasquez Galleries, Melbourne. By the late 1940s his works had grown in size and abstraction. Squares and circles appeared as recurring motifs, often fragmented across a shallow picture plane. 
Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, Roger Kemp worked in factories to support himself and his wife Merle Kemp. His profile soon rose when in the 1960s he won the John McCaughey Memorial Prize (1961) and the Blake Prize for Religious Art (1968 and also in 1970). In 1966 he embarked on his first trip overseas at the age of 58 and travelled extensively throughout Europe. From the late 1960s and into the 1970s, Kemp began to experiment with working on paper, producing a series of etchings. 
Roger Kemp taught at Prahran College of Adult Education in 1970 and then moved to London where he lived and worked for two years (1970-72) in the studio of the Space, Provision, Artistic, Cultural and Educational Project (S.P.A.C.E.). In 1972 Kemp returned to Melbourne and maintained a print studio with George Baldessin in Collins Street, Melbourne. (An exhibition of his etchings was held in 1972 at Rudy Komon Gallery, Sydney, while the Art Gallery of New South Wales toured ‘Roger Kemp: etchings’ during 1990-91).
In 1978, in celebration of his seventieth birthday, several exhibitions of Kemp’s work were held simultaneously across a number of locations: Monash University Gallery (Early Work c.1933-1945), College of the Arts Gallery (Metaphysical Paintings c.1945-1955), Melbourne University Gallery (Maturity 1955-1975), and the National Gallery of Victoria (Paintings on Paper: sequences 1968-1975). Ninety-one paintings selected by Professor Patrick McCaughey, in consultation with the artist, were exhibited across the four sites, with a fifth site, Realities Galleries, Toorak, showing a further 25 works. 
After a substantial and prolific career spanning more than five decades, Roger Kemp died in Melbourne, Victoria, on 14 September 1987. In the same year he was awarded the prestigious honour of an Order of Australia, a significant accolade that complemented the order of the British Empire that he had previously received in 1978. 
Throughout his career Roger Kemp received several awards, for example the D’Arcy Memorial Prize for Religious Art (1964), the International Co-operation Art Award (1969) and the Distinguished Artists Award presented by the Australia Council (1973). 
The art of Roger Kemp is represented in numerous Australian public collections such the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra; the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney; the Art Gallery of South Australia, Adelaide; the Art Gallery of Western Australia, Perth and the Castlemaine Art Gallery, Castlemaine. His work is also held in the Mertz Collection USA and the Australian Chancery, Washington, USA, as well as private and corporate collections across Australia, the UK and the USA. In the collection of the National Gallery of Victoria, and on display in the NGVI Great Hall, are tapestries based on paintings by Roger Kemp and woven by the Australian Tapestry Workshop, Melbourne.

Lucy Napaljarri Kennedy,"
Born c.1926 of the Warlpiri/Anmatyerre language/tribe, she lives at Yuendumu and is one of the senior women of the Yuendumu community whose interest in rendering traditional women’s designs in western materials was one of the driving forces behind early experiments with canvas at the settlement. Her work was included in the first exhibition of Yuendumu paintings at the Araluen Centre in Alice Springs in October 1985 and in many exhibitions of Warlukurlangu Artists since in Perth, Alice Springs, Adelaide, Sydney, Melbourne, and Darwin, also in England as part of the 1987 Portsmouth Festival. She participated in the SA Museum’s Yuendumu: Paintings out of the Desert in 1987-8, and the Dreamings exhibition which toured the USA in 1988-9 included Sugarleaf Dreaming at Ngarlu , 1986, on which Lucy collaborated with her countrywomen Ruth and Hilda Martin Napaljarri . Lucy’s heritage country is in the Coniston Station and Mt Allan area and she paints Miinypa (Native Fuschia), Marlu (Kangaroo) and Janganpa (Possum) Dreamings for this country. Lucy, Dolly Daniels and Bessie Sims are the only three women on the Yuendumu Council.

J. N. Kilgour,"
painter and illustrator, illustrated stories in Australia Week-end Book 1 (1942), e.g. drawing for Z.V. Webb’s 'Defeat’; a fat lady running from a fire for 'Fire!’, an article by Eva Linn; a bloodhound jumping at its German owner in order to eat him (but a very cheerful image) for M.W. Peacock’s 'In the Dead of Night’ (a Jewish Concentration Camp horror story), p.68; and a flying man for Don Edwards’s 'My Too Successful Pupil’, 106. Others in no.2 (1943) include p.68 (family looking at moon). In vol.3 (1944) his illustrations are mostly rather dark and straight, with a couple that are more linear, e.g. Yank soldier trying to shoot a dog for George M. Welch’s short story 'Vicksburg’ (60), a woman reading a newspaper for 'Appointment with Death’ by Jonathan Keon; a shopkeeper talking to a client for Gene Dowell’s 'The Great Australian Crime’, p.137 and a waitress pushing a plate onto a soldier’s chest for 'Reaction’ by Robina Sherwood (176). Nos 4 (1945) and 5 (1946) also have numerous small illustrated heads by Kilgour to the stories.
Stone lists 'J. Kilgour’ as one of the two artists who contributed to the one-off Offset Printing Company comic Action (c.1944) along with 'Theo”; he illustrated a story called 'Ronald Keene’. Mick Stone also attributes The Judy O’Neil Comic (c.1947) to Kilgour, but this looks far more like Kate O’Brien (ill. p.145).

Inge King,"
sculptor, was born in Berlin, Germany, on 25 November 1918. In 1951 she came to Melbourne – a city which struck her then as a sculptural desert – and spent the next eight or nine years adjusting to her new life, having her children and augmenting the family income by making and designing jewellery. Only a few sculptures were produced during this period, but in 1959 King, who had mostly worked in wood and stone, started welding. Her initial training had been as a wood-carver in Germany (1935-38), then at the Royal Academy in London and the Glasgow School of Art. After the war she had worked in London, where she held her first solo exhibition in 1949. A chance to travel to France and New York in 1950 confirmed the latter as the most exciting city she had experienced. There she saw Jackson Pollock’s paintings and made contact with members of the New York School, as well as exhibiting in a group show. Back at London she met and married an Australian artist, Graham King.
King’s early steel sculptures reflected a break with the past in the demands made by her use of a new material and in the inspiration and challenge offered by the vast spaces of the Australian landscape. Later she began to make steel maquettes: some complete in themselves, some models for large-scale works. Her first commission for a large sculpture came in 1971 with the RAAF Memorial in Canberra, followed in the same year by the Fred Schonell Memorial Fountain at Queensland University. These projects introduced King to collaborative work with engineers and welders and to the sort of detailed preparation with models and computation drawings critical to the monumental Forward Surge (1974-82), commissioned by the Victorian Arts Centre. Other works commissioned since the mid-1970s include sculptures for the University of Melbourne, La Trobe University, the Australian National University, Woden Valley Hospital, the State Bank of Victoria, the NSW Royal Blind Society Sculpture Award, ICI House in Melbourne, the McClelland Gallery Sculpture Park and the State Superannuation Board.
From 1969 King held regular solo exhibitions and participated in group shows and, from 1980, in the Sculpture Triennial exhibitions. She was a founding member of the Group of Four in 1953 and its successor during the 1960s, Centre Five. Both organisations aimed to promote public understanding and acceptance of sculpture, particularly through lectures and exhibitions, and were critical in creating a more receptive climate for it. Her educational interests also involved her in lecturing in sculpture at the School of Early Childhood Studies (1961-75) and at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) in 1976-87.
King is represented in institutional, state and regional galleries and in private collections in Australia, Europe, UK and USA. In 1984 she was awarded the Member of the Order of Australia. Further recognition of her contributions and achievements has come with honorary doctorates from Deakin University (1990) and RMIT (1993).

Peter Kingston,"
Born Sydney 1943 and was first introduced to art at Cranbrook school with Justin O’Brien, where he also met his friend and collaborator Martin Sharp.
On leaving school Kingson studied architecture and arts at the University of New South Wales, but was more interested in drawing than design. However his studies led to a long friendship with Jan Utzon, the son of Jorn Utzon, the architect for the Sydney Opera House. When Utzon was effectively dismissed by the Askin government in 1966, Kingston was one of many who marched in protest.Peter Kingston’s first published cartoons were drawn for the student newspaper, Tharunka. Later he gravitated to OZ, which was dominated by the graphic style of his old school friend, Martin Sharp. His first exhibition was at Hyde Park with Mlck Glasheen and John Allen. Later her participated in the OZ Super Art Market exhibition at Clune Galleries. He also made experimental movies.
In 1971 he became one of the artists who created the communal Yellow House in Sydney’s Kings Cross. His most important work from this time was his contribution to the Stone Room, made for the Spring 1971 exhibition. He also created the Elephant house, made magic shows and participated In some of the performances.
His love of the whimsical nature of comic book heroes led him to make fantasy versions of the life of the Phantom, as well as Snugglepot & Cuddlepie. His mother once knitted a jumper showing his design of Superman unzipping his fly.
In the 1970s, along with Martin Sharp, Peter Kingston became an activist in the campaign to save Luna Park from the developers. He was a fierce campaigner for Sydney’s heritage, whether it be the remnant bush land near his Lavender Bay home or the ferries on Sydney Harbour. The Harbour, the bridge, the ferries and the beauty of moonlight on water, iconic buildings and the bushy foreshores became dominant subjects in his later paintings.Even as he was dying from lung cancer, he continued to campaign to save North Sydney’s modernist MLC building from the hands of the developers.


"
Robert Klippel,"
Sculptor, was born at Potts Point, Sydney, on 19 June 1920, son of a successful businessman. He was educated at Cranbrook and Sydney Grammar and studied art at East Sydney Technical College. During WWII he served in minesweepers and as a gunner on a tanker, then was transferred to making scale models of ships for the Royal Australian Navy to use in recognition training. This led to a new interest in sculpture, beginning with monumental carved stone figures and changing in the 1940s to surrealist works. 'His sculptures and drawings completed in London and Paris in the 1940s are among the finest products of postwar European surrealism’, Edwards states. Influenced by Zen and Indian philosophies in the 1950s.
It was not until Klippel went to New York in 1957 and later, while teaching at the Minnesota School of Arts, that his talents began to be appreciated. After periods living in NY in the late 1950s and early 1960s, where his contemporaries included the giants of abstract expressionism, he settled in Birchgrove, Balmain, and began making the 1960s and ’70s spectacular non-figurative junk assemblages – monumental civic sculptures and intimately scale metal and plastic assemblages – for which he is best known.
In 1979 a solo exhibition at Sydney was a sell-out, with prices up to $18,000 and for many years before he died, on his 81st birthday, he was unquestionably Australia’s most celebrated sculptor. An exhibition of his large assemblages was held at Art Gallery of New South Wales in 1995. 30 small metal sculptures on show at Watters when he died (his dealer was Frank Watters), all made within the past 12 months, were of equal quality to any of his work. Deborah Edwards was preparing a retrospective when he died, on his 81st birthday.


"
Emily Kame Kngwarreye,"
Born c.1910 at Alhalkere (Soakage Bore) Utopia Station, Emily is an Eastern Anmatyerre speaker and senior artist at Utopia. Her Country is Alhalkere and her Dreamings include Sand Goanna, Wild Orange, and Emu. Emily first saw white people as a young girl aged about nine. She worked in her younger days as a stockhand on pastoral properties in this area (see The Art of Utopia, M. Boulter) at a time when Aboriginal women on the stations were usually only employed as domestics – suggesting the forceful independence of her personality. Emily was the adopted daughter of Jacob Jones, a very important lawman in the Alyawarre community, and a leader in the women’s ceremonial business at Utopia.
From the time she painted her first canvas for A Summer Project 1988-9 , the work of Emily Kame Kngwarreye has received widespread acclaim and recognition. Emily found in acrylics and canvas a medium more suited to the bold immediacy of her style than the more laborious production processes of batik, in which she had been working for the preceding decade and exhibiting with the Utopia women in exhibitions in Australia and abroad since 1977. Her technique is highly individual with under-drawings covered by layers of dots. Her pleasure in working as an artist is reflected in her powerful colours and her energetic and expressive compositions. In 1990, Emily’s work was shown in two highly successful solo shows in Sydney, as well as the Art Gallery of NSW’s Abstraction show. Later that year she participated in the CAAMA/Utopia artists-in-residence program at the ICA, Perth. (Reference: Batty, P. & Sheridan, N., Utopia Artist in Residence Project [Holmes à Court Foundation, Perth, 1990]). Several more solo shows have followed: Gallery Gabrielle Pizzi, Melbourne (1990, 1991) and Utopia Art, Sydney (1991, 1992). Her work was rapidly acquired by major public and private collections in Australia and overseas and is keenly sought after by other buyers. In three years, she has been represented in 48 group exhibitions around Australia and the world, including Ireland – A Picture Story , Royal Hibernian Gallery, Dublin; Russia – Aboriginal Paintings from the Desert , Union Gallery, Moscow, 1991 and touring St Petersburg, Ukraine, Minsk Byelorussia, Riga Latvia; USA – Contemporary Aboriginal Art , Harvard University and touring USA and Australia; Japan – Aboriginal Art from Australia , National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo, 1992 and Crossroads Toward a New Reality , National Museum of Modern Art, Kyoto and Tokyo etc.
She is the most lauded painter of the Utopia art movement to date, and one of the best known of the desert artists, painting with an undiminished energy which belies her years. In 1992 she was awarded an Australian Artists Creative Fellowship. In 1993 she exhibited in the Joan and Peter Clemenger Triennial Exhibition of Contemporary Australian Art at the National Gallery of Victoria and featured in Aratjara – Art of the First Australians , touring Dusseldorf, London and other European Galleries.

Mark Knight,"
cartoonist, began drawing cartoons for the Waterside Workers’ Federation as a lad. In the 1980s he mainly drew for the Australian Financial Review where he had started work as a copy boy. A cartoon of 1985 was included in Christine Dixon’s exhibition (not ill.). He also contributed cartoons to the Sydney Morning Herald , to Choice magazine, etc. Four originals for the Bulletin dated 12 November 1983 & undated (ML PXD 739) include caricatures of Paul Keating, Bob Hawke and Prince Charles & Diana. He was included with John Spooner in Joe Szabo’s The Finest International Political Cartoons of Our Time .
Knight was appointed political cartoonist on the Melbourne Herald and Herald Sun was still working there in 2007. He had cartoons in Kaz Cooke’s Beyond a Joke: The Anti-Bicentenary Cartoon Book (Penguin, 1988), pp. 63 ('The P.M. [Hawke] re-discovers the aboriginies [sic]’), 97 (death in custody), 109 (Hawke), 113 ('Aboriginal Art [hands]/ White man’s art [Maralinga Test site Aboriginal reserve – bodies]’) – some presumably first published in the Melbourne Herald Sun . He also drew a cartoon for the 1991 'Quit’ campaign (original ML PxD 672/15).
Three original cartoons published in the Herald Sun in 1996-97 were exhibited in the NMA/ Old Parliament House exhibition Bringing the House Down: 12 Months of Australian Political Humour (Canberra, 1997), cats 53 (on Pauline Hanson), 65 (on Senator Colston) and 81 ('Sojourner PM’, on the unemployed). He exhibited the following year and spoke on his work at the NMA Seminar on Australian Political Cartooning at Old Parliament House on 5 December 1998. He had two cartoons in the 2001 show and probably in the intervening ones.
Other publications in which Knight’s cartoons appeared include Christopher Sheil’s War on the Wharves: A cartoon history (Evatt Foundation & Pluto Press, Annandale NSW, 1998), an anthology of newspaper cartoons about the 1998 Wharfies’ strike. A witty cartoon, The announcement of Bob and Hazel’s Divorce , showing Bob weeping to the media 'This is a very sad moment for Hazel and I…’ while Hazel does a joyful handstand in the background, was reused in Ann Turner’s book of interviews, In Their Image: Contemporary Australian Cartoonists (NLA, 2000). Turner claimed in the NLA News (October 2000) that on the criteria she established for the book (circulation figures) Knight and Warren Brown of the Sydney Daily Telegraph were the most influential cartoonists in Australia. Both appear seven days a week. The Herald Sun sells over 560,000 copies on weekdays (making it Australia’s largest selling weekday paper), 520,000 copies on Saturdays and 530,000 on Sundays (figures Turner took from the Audit Bureau of Statistics c.1999).


"
Jack Louis Koskie,"
Jack Koskie, painter, printmaker, teacher and graphic designer, was born in Hull, Yorkshire in 1914. At the age of sixteen he embarked upon his first sea voyage in an Iceland-bound trawler; the sea later proved to be an important theme in this artist’s oeuvre. In around 1930, while Koskie was a student at the Hull College of the Arts, he was awarded a scholarship to study art in Rotterdam and Paris. In the next stage of his travels, Koskie emigrated to Australia in 1939 where he continued his artistic training at East Sydney Tech and later at Hobart Tech. 
During the Second World War, Koskie served in the Merchant Navy and then with the Australian Army Engineers as a camouflage designer. Upon his discharge, he travelled around Australia with “brush and pen” in hand, exploring his adopted homeland and studying the scenery it had to offer. In what was to be a rich and varied career, Koskie first settled in Sydney and worked as a publisher’s designer and illustrator for many of Australia’s leading publications such as Invisible Press, The Sydney Morning Herald, Women’s Weekly, as well as the Commonwealth Office of Education in Sydney and Tasmanian Government Printer. Later moving to Tasmania, he served as the Head of the Department of Graphic Design and Print Making at the Hobart Technical College. This was followed by his position as lecturer in Printmaking at the Gordon Institute of Technology, Geelong, his tenure of office as the senior art master at Mount Scopus College near Melbourne, Victoria, and his time as Lecturer in Printmaking at Deakin University, where he finished his teaching career in 1979. 
Whilst serving in the various teaching positions just mentioned, Koskie had continued his own artistic practice in painting (oils and watercolours) and printmaking (for example lithography). A key work in his career was the illustrated publication Ships that Shaped Australia (Sydney: A & R, 1987). The result of years of extensive research, this book contained images of ships, painted by Koskie that had played a key role in the history of Australia. With an eye for detail and historical accuracy, Koskie attempted to ascertain the weather on the day a ship entered the harbour for the first time, including wind direction. In some cases, such as Kangaroo Point in Brisbane, the artist visited the harbour in question to capture the light and landscape for his scenery. Koskie received a range of commissions owing to his unique knowledge as a marine specialist, including the Story of Ships for the NSW Department of Education; Golden Fleece, Captain Cook Centenary Calendar; illustrated shipping features for The Sydney Morning Herald and Reveille, R.S.L. magazine; and a painting for the Geelong Historical Society’s Matthew Flinders celebrations.
Throughout his career, Koskie, exhibited with several major art societies, including the Victorian Artists Society and the Art Society of Tasmania. He further participated in a wide range of group exhibitions including the Lord Mayors Art Prize (Melbourne), ACTA Marine Paintings Prize and the St Kilda Arts Festival. His first solo show was held at Coombe Down Galleries in Newtown Victoria in 1971, where he exhibited landscape paintings of Geelong and nearby locations, as well as scenes from his time in New South Wales and Tasmania. A comprehensive retrospective showcase of his work was held at Sandridge Gallery, Port Melbourne in October 1998. 
Furthermore, Koskie received several awards during his career including the Ben Uri Art Prize (1963), Cato Art Prize for his oil painting Figure at the Pier (1970), Carlyon Graham Art Prize for his painting Low Tide Queenscliff (1969), Roland Prize (1970), Applied Chemical Prize (1975) and the Lord Mayors Art Prize, (Melbourne City Council) (1980).  Adding to his accomplishments, Koskie was a member of the Journalist Club of New South Wales, the Victorian Artist Society and he was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (London).  
Following a unique and diverse artistic career in Australia, Jack Koskie passed away in 1997.
The art of Jack Koskie is represented in several prominent public Australian collections including the Australian War Memorial, Canberra; Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, Hobart; Government House, Hobart and Broken Hill Art Gallery, as well as private collections in the UK, USA and Australia.

Alun Leach-Jones,"
Alun Leach-Jones was the eldest child of a Welsh elementary school teacher father and a Scottish mother. His parents had met in Liverpool, but shortly after Alun’s birth the family returned to his father’s home in rural North Wales where he became the local schoolmaster, and his son’s first teacher. Alun did not speak English until he was ten. In 1947 an uncle, who was recovering from the War, showed him how to paint watercolours. When the family returned to Liverpool, Alun joined his uncles’ Post Office club, and was commissioned to paint murals, his first professional experience. From the age of 14 he worked at the Solicitor’s Law Society, making illuminated manuscripts for presentation. A workmate, Ronald McKenzie, introduced him to art, and they travelled to Paris where he saw Gauguin, and to the Prado in Madrid. Art became increasingly important and he enrolled in evening classes at Liverpool College of Art. In 1959 Leach-Jones travelled to London to see New American Painting  at the Tate, an exhibition that introduced him to Abstract Expressionism, and changed the way he thought about colour and form.The following year he travelled to Adelaide as an assisted immigrant, where he worked at various jobs including as a library assistant, before enrolling in night classes at the South Australian School of Art where he said his “real professional life started”. It was also where he met his wife, fellow artist Nola Jones. Kym Bonython noticed Leach-Jones’ constant visits to his gallery, and encouraged the budding artist by giving him a place to live in the gallery in return for assistance with installing exhibitions and caretaking duties. Leach-Jones’ interest in art books at the Mary Martin bookshop piqued the attention of Max Harris, who commissioned him to illustrate a book, and introduced him to Sidney Nolan which gave him a sense that art could be a career.The South Australian School of Art also led him to an interest in the possibilities of printmaking, led by Udo Sellbach, Karin Schepers and Geoffrey Brown.In 1964 Leach-Jones and his wife Nola travelled to England where she studied at the Chelsea School of Art, while he became involved in the Contemporary Art Society. He shared a studio with the English abstract painter Brian Plummer. Consequently he met other artists including Patrick Heron and Norbert Linton. London finessed his screen-printing technique and he started to make images of intricate abstract beauty, with the generic title “Noumenon”, which he described as “the idea of perceiving a purely intellectual entity”. He continued working in this direction on his return to Australia, this time to Melbourne, in 1964. The same year he held his first successful solo exhibition at Australian Galleries, which was soon followed by exhibitions in other cities. His meditative intricate abstract works led to him exhibiting in The Field in 1968 and being regarded as one of Australia’s leading abstract artists. In 1969 he represented Australia at the Bienale del Sao Paulo, in Brazil.The same year he was appointed as a teacher at the Prahran College of Advanced Education, also taught at the National Gallery of Victoria School. This was followed by an appointment at the Victorian College of the Arts in 1972 and the City Art Institute (later known as the College of Fine Arts, UNSW) in 1978. His significance as a printmaker was first recognised in 1967 when he was made a Print Patron of the Print Council of Australia, and his  achievement in a British context was recognised in 1990 when he was made an Honorary Life Fellow of the Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers, UK.The significance of Alun Leach-Jones as a printmaker as well as a painter was early recognised by the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Australia Council which, in 1974, chose him to exhibit at the Lalit Kala Academy in New Delhi. This was followed by other exhibitions and residencies in Malaysia, Singapore and New York.In 1980 Leach-Jones undertook a residency in Berlin, at the Kunstlerhaus Bethanian. His studio was next to the death zone of the Wall, place of concrete, barbed wire and dead animals.From this came a turning point in his art, with the series “The Romance of Death” which was triggered in part by the efforts of those trying to cross the wall.
 In the 1990s, influenced by what he described as 'Welsh melancholy’ he made a series grouped under the title “The Instruments for a Solitary Navigator”. He later described these as “like a slime trail left by the snail behind him”.In 1999, encouraged by his friends Lenton Parr and Robert Klippel, he began to make sculpture which was the subject of several of exhibitions in commercial galleries.Towards the end of his life there was a renewed interest in the mid-century Abstract artists and the way the daring young men who painted in precise colours had helped shape modern Australian art.


"
Margo Lewers,"
A painter and craftworker, Margot Lewers is best known for her abstract paintings produced after 1955. An innovative approach and exploration of different media informed her entire professional life. Born in Sydney to a German father, Adolph Plate, a painter and writer who travelled extensively in the Pacific before his early death in 1913, Margo and her brothers, one of whom was the painter Carl Plate , grew up in an improvised one-parent household. However, their mother, Gilly Plate, gave the children the confidence to believe in themselves and this enabled Margo to embark on a lifelong career as a visual artist and craftworker without formal training. The little art education she did receive consisted of a short period studying drawing, painting and textile design at the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London (1934) and irregular painting classes with Desiderius Orban in Sydney (1945-50). By the age of 21, Margo had established a studio in Sydney, making and selling a range of craft objects, including pottery, hand-printed fabrics and wooden utensils. With funds from this venture she started a successful commercial pottery business, employing a production potter who worked to her designs. Following her marriage to the sculptor Gerald Lewers in 1933, she travelled to England and Europe. Visits to exhibitions and meetings with artists such as Ben Nicholson, Barbara Hepworth and the art critic Herbert Read introduced her to the ideas underpinning modernism. A commitment to them shaped the direction of all her future work.
Lewers was an admirer of the Bauhaus design movement which she experienced during travels in Germany in 1934. An illustrated article on the Bauhaus had previously appeared in an Australian magazine, “The Home”, in 1 October 1928 Henry Pynor. “Visit old Countries for New Ideas for your Home.” The Home 1 October 1928, pps. 48-49. and her associate Sydney Ancher had travelled in Germany in 1931 and returned home with the same enthusiasm. After Lewers returned to Sydney in 1935 she opened a consultancy design service and shop called Notanda in Rowe Street. The stock included simple hand-made pottery, designed by her or imported from Mexico, bold linoblock-printed fabrics, small, carved wooden sculptures by Gerald Lewers and undecorated timber furniture designed with strong flowing lines. She combined the Arts and Crafts tradition with a minimalist approach to interior design.
In 1941 Margo was a founding member of the Contemporary Art Society in Sydney. Her active involvement provided the impetus for a shift away from design towards painting. In order to create a feeling of depth and space, she began exploring the relationship of colour and light. She held her first solo exhibition of abstract paintings in 1952 and was soon making a significant contribution to the development of modernism in Sydney. As a leading abstract expressionist painter, she received favourable reviews, won 14 art awards and during the 1940s and ’60s her work was included in major Australian contemporary exhibitions that toured overseas.
Margo also explored other media such as plexiglass, painted fabrics and mosaics, undertaking significant public commissions including mosaic walls and landscaped gardens. After Gerald’s death she completed a relief sculpture for the Reserve Bank, Canberra, based on his model. Her work is represented in all state and national collections
Margo Lewers held a joint exhibition with her husband, the sculptor Gerald Lewers, at the Peter Bray Gallery in Melbourne in 1952. In that exhibition Studio stood out as Margo’s most accomplished work in geometric abstraction. This watercolour is characteristic of the painting style known as geometric constructivism, a mode of painting based on the principles of dynamic symmetry commonly attributed to the painters Grace Crowley , Ralph Balson and Frank Hinder, leading members of the Sydney Modernist School. The influence of these artists on Margo’s work at this time was significant, as was the work of Barbara Hepworth and Ben Nicholson, two of the British modernist artists she had met in England in 1934. In particular, Nicholson’s abstract still lifes and painted reliefs of the early 1930s had a profound influence on her later abstract compositions.
After returning to Australia, Margo Lewers studied under the influential teacher and artist Desiderius Orban. He encouraged her to be spontaneous and to adopt a more intuitive approach to colour, line and space. However, it was not until the early 1950s and her involvement and experimentation with constructivism that her paintings successfully synthesised the technical qualities of geometric abstraction with the transparency and luminosity of watercolour. This transitional period was significant in several respects. It shaped her career as a painter and was a major influence for her more mature expressionist and abstract works in the late 1950s and 1960s. Interestingly, Margo’s arrangement of translucent overlays of subdued colour punctuated by a vertical thrust of overlocking diagonal lines and semi-circles evident in Studio later recur in her painted fabrics and coloured plexiglass constructions of the early 1970s.
Studio exemplifies the culmination of Margo Lewers’s early formal study and experimentation with abstraction, with the technical qualities of watercolour painting and the oblique framing of space through drawing. Studio is unlike her earlier geometric compositions of the late 1940s. These preliminary, painterly investigations into formal abstraction were laboured and contrived and her watercolour techniques were not as refined or skilfully executed. It took several years while living at Emu Plains-where she devoted herself to full-time painting-for the transition from academic abstraction to personal iconography to manifest itself. Characteristically, Studio articulates an inner tension and spiritual presence suggestive of stained-glass windows. The painting also symbolises and signals Margo Lewers’s departure from geometric abstraction to abstract expressionism.

Janet Nakamarra Long,"
Born at Anningie in 1960, Janet Long is a Warlpiri speaker whose traditional country is Wantapari. Her aunts May and Molly Napurrula showed her the body paint designs for Wantapari Dreaming. She began painting on small boards in 1989 when the Willowra store first began stocking paint and canvas to supply local artists. Her half brother, Malcolm Jagamara , showed her how to paint in the new medium. On canvas, she paints Frog, Snake, Orphan Child and Witchetty Grub Dreamings. Janet Long was the Literacy Worker at Willowra School, producing bi-lingual literature for use in the teaching program. To that point, she had lived all her life in Willowra, but her bi-lingualism and skill in dealing with western systems were increasingly drawing her into wider contacts, including research assistance in the gathering of biographical data on the Willowra artists for this dictionary. All statements in this dictionary from Willowra artists were gathered and translated into English by Janet.

Keith Looby,"
painter and illustrator, was born in Sydney. After studying at East Sydney Technical College in 1955-60 he went overseas in 1960 and lived in Italy and London until 1967. An elaborate pencil drawing was exhibited at the Royal Academy, London in the 1960s. He held an Australian National University Creative Arts Fellowship in 1973-74. His pen and ink History of the World (ill. McCulloch) is part of an extensive on-going series. His History of Australia, Part 1 1976, a portfolio of 6 etchings, includes 'MacArthur’s Sheep’, 'Massacre of Tasmanians’ and 'Aboriginal Family’. History of Australia, Part II 1977, another portfolio of 6 etchings in an edition of 50, consists of 'Kelly’, 'Kelly Hung’, 'Eureka Stockade’, 'Justice’, 'Sportsmen’s Club’ and 'Around Heidelberg’. Proofed and printed by Rose Vickers (CoFA), both sets were published by Port Jackson Press. Together they became Looby’s Black-and-White History of Australia .

Euan Macleod,"
painter born in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 1956. He arrived in Sydney in 1981, and had his first exhibition the following year at Watters Gallery, East Sydney, where he has exhibited regularly ever since. He has gone on to exhibit his work across Australia – at Niagara Galleries, Melbourne; Victor Mace Fine Art, Brisbane and is included in many group exhibitions in public and private galleries every year. Macleod also shows regularly in New Zealand, at Brooke/Gifford Gallery, Christchurch and Bowen Galleries, Wellington.
Euan Macleod: The Painter in the Painting , is a major study of Macleod’s work. The publication of this book which traces three decades of Macleod’s career, coincided with an important retrospective exhibition of the artist’s work that started in Sydney at the S. H. Ervin Gallery, and traveled to Tweed River Art Gallery, Orange Regional Gallery, Mornington Peninsula Regional Gallery, Newcastle Region Art Gallery and the University of Queensland Art Museum.
In his foreword to Euan Macleod: The Painter in the Painting John McDonald writes:
The drama of Macleod’s life is all in his work – in the increasingly complex play of symbols that simultaneously conceals and reveals his thoughts and feelings, and in the energetic application of paint to a flat surface … He is a painter who finds his fulfilment in action rather than reflection. The imagery comes first; the meaning emerges gradually, almost reluctantly (2010).
From 1991 on, Macleod has painted haunting images of a single male figure in the Australian/New Zealand sea, sky and landscape. These figures are very often huge in relation to their surroundings – sitting inside burnt-out craters, or striding, arms extended out beyond their bodies to blend into mountains.
Macleod has won a number of awards, including, the Archibald Prize (1999), the Sulman Prize (2001), the Blake Prize of Religious Art (2006) and the Gallipoli Art Prize in 2009 (O’Brien, 2010).
His work is included in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, USA), the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa (Wellington, NZ), the Christchurch Art Gallery (Christchurch, NZ), the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra, ACT), the National Gallery of Victoria (Melbourne, VIC), and the Art Gallery of Western Australia in Perth, WA (O’Brien, 2010).
In 2011 the artist was living in Sydney, NSW.


"
Bea Maddock,"
Tasmanian born artist mainly known as a printmaker, Bea Maddock also worked in painting, drawing and photography.
Beatrice Louise Maddock was born in Hobart, Tasmania, in 1934. Beatrice and her twin sister, Frances, were the youngest of the four children of two amateur artists, Henry Mervyn Maddock, an Anglican clergyman, and Thelma Annie. The family lived in various country parishes of Tasmania.
In 1956, Maddock graduated with a Fine Art degree from the Hobart Technical College where she had studied part-time under Jack Carington Smith, Dorothy Stoner, Jack Koskie and Stephen Walker. During her studies, she worked at the Visual Aids Centre at the Tasmanian Education Department. Maddock taught in high schools while studying art education at the University of Tasmania. Artist and former teacher Jack Carington Smith encouraged her to apply to the Slade School of Art in London. She was accepted, and left in 1959 to pursue postgraduate painting and printmaking with William Coldstream, Anthony Gross (etching) and Ceri Richards (lithography).
During her European journey, she traveled in Scotland, England, France, Holland, Italy, and Germany. She studied at the Academi de Bell Arti in Perugia, Italy, on a one-month scholarship. She went to churches and sketched in notebooks, observing Masaccio’s paintings and other religious sculptures. Because of the language barrier and the poor teaching at the provincial school, Maddock and her fellow student Murray Walker quit the classes to spend most of their time in the landscape. Maddock found great interest and inspiration in the art and landscape of Umbria and Tuscany. She painted works like Italian landscape (1961) outdoors on small canvases she carried. At the Slade School, she had been criticized for drawing too well and using too many colours, a palette she had been taught in Tasmania. After mainly working in tones of green, her Italian experience diversified her palette again. In Paris, she was impressed by the works of Georges Rouault, the French Fauvist and Expressionist painter and printmaker. Her print works at the Slade, like her 1960 Self-portrait , were influenced by Rouault’s emphatic gestures and strong black outlines. She admired German Expressionism in Munich and Essen, and would later study German Expressionist prints at the National Gallery of Victoria Print Room when living in Melbourne in 1964. Maddock travelled back to Australia by boat in 1961, stopping in Bombay, India. There, she was deeply confronted by the poverty, and she considered her experience in India as a milestone.
Upon her return to Australia, Maddock spent two years in Launceston, studying ceramics, teaching, painting, and printing. In 1964, she had her first solo exhibition in Launceston: Paintings, Drawings, and Prints by Bea Maddock. She then moved to South Melbourne, where she worked in a furniture factory to make ends meet. The city influenced her Figure series, which she would work on until 1968. Maddock moved back to Launceston in 1965 to teach ceramics, printmaking, drawing and basic design. Even after she moved, her works were still based on her Melbourne experience.
Bea Maddock won many prizes including the Tasmanian Drawing Prize in 1968, with Figure in a place , and the F.E. Richardson Print Prize in 1969, with Midnight (part of the Day series).
By the late 1960s, the artist established herself as a printmaker and in 1970, the National Gallery of Victoria Art School in Melbourne invited Maddock to teach printmaking. There, she was also able to dedicate time to her own work with the advanced printmaking technology, and started making photo-screenprints and photo-etchings. Her promotion of these two practices through teaching was extremely important in Australian art schools. In 1973, Maddock was appointed Senior Lecturer in Printmaking at the Victorian College of the Arts (formerly National Gallery of Victoria Art School).
During the 1970s Maddock worked mainly in series which paralleled the sequential nature of newspapers, as she was commenting in her work on the omnipresence of mass media. She used newspaper clippings and other found materials in her work, like the photograph of a criminal in a local newspaper she used in the photo-etching Philosophy I (1972).
In 1974, she won the 4th prize at the International Print Biennale in Poland for the photo-etching Square (1972) and received her first commission, from the Print Council of Australia, to produce a member print. A Creative Arts Fellowship at the Australian National University of Canberra allowed her to spend all of 1976 on her own work. She then received a Commission (1977) from the Visual Arts Board for the VIIth International Exhibition in New Delhi, for which she produced ten prints – the Journey series, Four by Two , and Two by Two . The same year, the Commonwealth Games Print Portfolio in Edmonton, Canada, commissioned her to produce a print. She traveled to Canada, then the United States, where she saw the work of Jasper Johns at the Whitney Museum of American Art, a Paul Cezanne exhibition at the MOMA and other public collections in New York. Jasper Johns and Andy Warhol were important influences on Maddock’s work, with their extensive use of serial imagery, grid format, and photography. Numeral 1 (1984) is an example of one of Maddock’s responses to Jasper Johns’ serial work.
From 1979-80, she was Acting Dean at the Victorian College of the Arts and worked on a commission of twelve encaustic panels for the High Court of Australia, Canberra. She resigned from her Senior Lectureship at the Victorian College of the Arts in 1981, and became part-time lecturer at the Bendigo College of Advanced Education in 1982. Living in Macedon, Maddock created the Access Studio, a space for ex-students to use. Sadly, the 1983 Ash Wednesday bush fires destroyed Maddock’s Macedon studio and house. (She would later recreate the Access Studio at the Red Lion paper mill in Dunolly.)
Maddock toured New Zealand and gave lectures, along with her exhibition Bea Maddock Prints 1960-1982. She returned to teaching in Launceston, Tasmania, for one year until 1984, when she resigned from teaching altogether in order to devote herself entirely to her own work. Maddock had always had a strong desire to educate, but she knew that time consuming teaching was incompatible with her career. The following year, she was appointed member of the Council of the Australian National Gallery and was also Chairperson of Ritchies Mill Arts Centre in Launceston.
In 1987, the Artists in Antarctica Program invited Maddock on a trip to Antarctica. It inspired her Forty Pages from Antarctica , a suite of etchings. That year, she also produced, under the commission of the Australian National Gallery, the encaustic panels We live in the meanings we are able to discern for the ANZ Bicentennial Art Commission.
Text is a feature of Maddock’s visual language. The Parliament House Construction Authority commissioned Maddock to design two posters using quotes chosen by historian Manning Clark. Completed in 1989 for the Manton exhibition, Queensland Art Gallery, the four panel encaustic painting Tromemanner – forgive us our trespass is a good example of the importance of words in Maddock’s art.
Maddock’s work is held in the collections of the Australian National Gallery in Canberra, all State galleries and other collections in Australia, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the National Gallery in Washington.
Maddock is a Member of the Order of Australia.

Guy Maestri,"
Guy Maestri was born in Mudgee, New South Wales, in 1974. He completed a Bachelor of Fine Arts (Honours) in painting at the National Art School (NAS), Sydney, in 2002 and in the same year was Highly Commended in the Brett Whiteley Travelling Art Scholarship exhibition. He received the commendation again in 2003, a year that also saw him win the NAS Paris Studio Award residency and the William Fletcher Fellowshi
As a landscape painter, Maestri is gestural, abstract and experimental. Although upon occasion he makes sculptures, such as the resin cane toads which feature in his work Unnatural Selection (2008), he finds painting a more satisfying medium as it is more immediate than the time consuming process of moulding and casting sculpture. Maestri regards his portrayal of the natural world as more instinctive than deliberate. Having grown up in the Australian countryside, he enjoys capturing observations of wildlife, noting at the same time humanity’s impact on the natural environment. Painting from his studio in the Sydney suburb of Chippendale, Maestri works from his memories and experiences of regional Australia.
His Field Studies (2008) series explores the gradual elimination of certain features from the natural world. Not only does Maestri often paint endangered species but, within the one work, he can repeat a species form over and over until the “confident tracing of a shape appears lost through repetition” (Chow 2008). In Gang Gang (2007), he chooses not to depict a bird literally, but to capture a sense of the creature by allowing the image to emerge and disappear through layering.
Maestri’s 'Natural Selection’ exhibition of 2008 was a series of paintings that resulted from his visit to a friend’s farm in Victoria. Affected by the degraded and dry land, he painted abstract landscapes and made use of found objects he brought back to his studio. The Darwinian title to the exhibition is intrinsically linked to related ideas in Maestri’s work: he is interested in the way native and introduced species interact, the theory of natural selection, extinction, ecosystems, erosion, sedimentation, forgetfulness and memory.Once a year Maestri steers himself away from the natural environment to paint a portrait for the Archibald Prize. Having being rejected eight times, then winning the People’s Choice Award at the 2001 Salon des Refuses, in 2009 Maestri won the Archibald Prize. His winning entry was a portrait of blind Indigenous singer Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu, which Maestri painted after being moved by Yunupingu’s performance at the Peats Ridge Festival in 2008. Maestri took the opportunity to meet Yunupingu at the airport, where he drew sketches and took a photograph. From this experience Maestri “got a sense of his presence and this determined the nature of the portrait: quiet and strong” (Art Gallery of New South Wales 2009).For Maestri the Archibald Prize, “kick started a whole new way of approaching painting,” (Maestri in Droll 2009). His focus shifted from local environment to global, from abstract to figurative, and from a colourful to a monochromatic palette. Referencing images taken from the web, his 2009 show at Tim Olsen Gallery, 'Google Earth’, included observations of humanity’s struggles with mortality and interrelated concerns about the effects of global warming on nature. Maestri has had numerous solo exhibitions in Australia and has also exhibited internationally in the United Kingdom and the United States and Hong Kong. He was a finalist in the 2007 and 2008 Dobell Drawing Prize.


"
Marguerite Henriette Mahood,"
painter, ceramic and metalwork artist, cartoonist, illustrator, lecturer and art historian, was born in Richmond, Victoria, on 29 July 1901, daughter of Henry Callaway and Marguerite, née Deschamps. After attending the Presbyterian Ladies College, she studied drawing at the National Gallery School in 1916-20 under Frederick McCubbin and W.B. McInnes, then undertook an Applied Arts course at the Melbourne Working Men’s College (RMIT) and studied independently with Leslie Wilkie.
She returned to RMIT in 1930 in order to study ceramic techniques under Gladys Kelly. This was unsatisfactory, so she taught herself from books, producing her first ceramic works in 1931. They were fired in a coke kiln built by her husband, Thomas Orrock Mahood, an engineer and her 'life-long collaborator and co-worker’, whom she married in 1923. Their son, Martin, was born in 1938 but died soon afterwards.
From 1918, when she showed illustrations for a memorial volume of Adam Lindsay Gordon’s poems and other drawings, Mahood exhibited decorative art nouveau watercolours with the Victorian Artists’ Society (VAS) and produced linocuts in the 1920s. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s she had successful solo exhibitions of her ceramic plaques, masks and figures in Melbourne and one (in 1947) at the David Jones Gallery, Sydney. She identified her ceramic work with her monogram and dated it with a letter code, beginning with 'A’ for the first year of production (1931).
Mahood continued to exhibit with the VAS – now showing ceramic pieces – as well as with the Arts and Crafts Society of Victoria (1933-34) and the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors of which she was a member from 1927; she showed linocuts of animals at its exhibitions in the late 1950s. In 1956 her ceramic work was shown in the Melbourne Olympic Games Women’s Art Exhibition, including one of her masks, Splendour (Shepparton AG). All her female masks, she said, were based on Marlene Dietrich.
As 'Margot’ Mahood she also became known as a cartoonist and illustrator, beginning with a series of humorous natural history pictorial features in the 'Wild Life’ section of the Herald and Weekly Times in 1944 which continued for eight years. Bim in the Bush , Bim and His Friends and Bim at Bimbang Junction appeared in 'Wild Life’, Tim the Terrier in 'Our Women’ and The Scientific Adventures of Professor Smeebolger in 'Australian Boy’. Pinknose the Possum and The Sandmans were published in the Age . Her book, The Whispering Stone , also appeared in 1944. A primer, Drawing Australian Animals , was published in 1952.
She ran a screen-printing firm in 1947-51, and she also produced oil paintings such as a haunting image of a young urban Aboriginal woman, The Disinherited (c.1945, Deutscher Fine Art), in which the social realist attitudes that also made her a member of the Communist Party are most obvious.
Late in life (1970) she was awarded a PhD from the University of Melbourne for her thesis on nineteenth-century political cartoons, published as The Loaded Line in 1973 and still the standard reference. She also contributed entries on cartoonists to Joan Kerr’s Dictionary of Australian Artists’ project, most of which were published in the pre-1870 volume in 1992. She was working on a book on the development of Melbourne social and political life as seen in cartoons when she died in 1989, aged 88.

Dusan Marek,
Mandy Martin,"
Mandy Martin who first emerged as a political activist printmaker and painter, was born in Adelaide in 1952, the daughter of Peter Martin, a professor of Botany and Beryl Martin, a watercolor painter. She first studied at the South Australian School of Art from 1972 to 1975. She first came to prominence as one of the political activists in the Women’s art movement, and exhibited in Fantasy and Reality, alongside Jude Adams, Frances Phoenix and Toni Robertson. Her feminism was very much tinged with political activism. Some of her early works included posters against the Vietnam War and other acts of American imperialism. Along with fellow artists Ann Newmarch and Robert Boynes she became one of the activist of the Progressive Art Movement.After she moved to Canberra with her first husband, the artist Robert Boynes, she taught at the Canberra School of Art at the Australian National University from 1978 until 2003. In 1995 she relocated to Mandurama in rural New South Wales. She continued her close association with ANU, so much so that on her departure she was  appointed a Fellow of the University until 2008 when she became Adjunct Professor at the Fenner School of Environment and Society, a position she held until 2018. The new appointment reflected the change in the focus of her art as she moved from a tough political and social critique to an equally rigorous commentary on how out fragile environment suffers from both climate change and mining.Many of her large-scale paintings served as a critique of the degradation of the land in both rural and urban Australia. In 1988, Red Ochre Grove, which has been described by Sasha Grishin as “an apocalyptic intense landscape”, was commissioned for the main committee room at the new Australian Parliament House.In 2017 a touring exhibition of her paintings demonstrated the fragility of land damaged by coal mining and poor management.Her later works included large scale installations, made in collaboration with her son, Alexander Boynes.

Ricky Maynard,"
Ricky Maynard, photographer, was born in Launceston, Tasmania in 1953. A descendant of the Big River and Ben Lomond people, in 2007 the artist was based on Cape Barren Island, off the north east coast of Tasmania. Maynard developed a fascination for photography early in life when, at the age of 16, he was employed as a darkroom technician working with aerial photographs at a processing business in Melbourne. Starting with this formative experience, Maynard’s practice has been underpinned by a thorough technical knowledge of chemistry and photographic optics, honed through further periods of study and employment. These included a three year traineeship as a photographer at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies in Canberra from 1983, and a year’s study at the International Centre for Photography in New York in 1990, funded by a grant from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Arts Board of the Australia Council for the Arts. Maynard has worked as a photographer’s assistant at the Antarctic Division in Kingston, Tasmania and as a part time photographic teacher at Hobart Technical College. He was also a founding member of M.33 Photoagency in Melbourne. Maynard’s career as a documentary photographer gained momentum in 1985 when he was commissioned, along with 19 other photographers, to contribute work to the After 200 years project. Established in the lead up to Australia’s bicentenary, the project’s aim was to make possible new approaches to representing Aboriginal people, who historically had so often been the subject of negative and parochial photographic portrayals. Maynard chose to document the lives of members of his community in Tasmania during the mutton birding season, and the result was the Moonbird People (1985-88) series. The spirit of this project, particularly its emphasis on empowering the subject to direct the photographic process, was highly formative of Maynard’s approach to the craft. Maynard remains committed to a humanist approach to documentary photography whereby the objective is not merely to record social life, but to bring compassion, dignity and honesty to the exchange between photographer and subject, and to treat photography as a means of communication that can potentially bring about social change. In Maynard’s words:  'Standard photographic technique is essentially an act of subjugation, in which people are invariably reduced to objects for the use of the photographer. To build an alternative practice, a convivial photography, we need to abolish this oppressive relationship. Co-authorship must be established beforehand. It is impossible to fight oppression by reproducing it’ (Museum of Contemporary Art media release, 2005).  Maynard’s work to date has consistently affirmed this philosophy. For example, the No More Than What You See series (1993) resulted from a commission from the South Australian Department of Correctional Services to coincide with the Year of Indigenous Peoples and to engage with the concerns raised by the 1988 Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody Report. The series, which documented the lives of Aboriginal prisoners in South Australian gaols, was first exhibited at Stills Gallery in Sydney and established Maynard’s ongoing representation by the gallery. In 1994 it was awarded the Mother Jones International Documentary Award, and in 1997 it won the Australian Human Rights Award for Photography. In 2000 Maynard collaborated with writer Tony Birch to produce the publication Reversing the Negatives: a Portrait of Aboriginal Victoria, and this collection of work was exhibited at Gasworks, Melbourne in 2001. The series Returning to Places that Name Us (2000), which was awarded the 2003 Kate Challis RAKA Award, consists of five large scale, intimate portraits of Wik elders. As with all of Maynard’s work, the images resulted from a patient, respectful and collaborative period of association with the subjects, and sought to compel viewers to reflect upon the faces of those whose identity in the public eye had become somewhat reified by the politics surrounding the High Court 'Wik decision’ (1996), which recognised the survival of their native title rights over pastoral land in the Cape York Peninsular. His most recent series Portrait of a distant land (2005 – 2007) consists of photos taken in Tasmania compiled over the 20 years of his practice, and is partly concerned with undermining the robust myth that Tasmania’s Aboriginal population did not survive colonisation. The series presents an environment humanised by a resilient Aboriginal presence, depicting sites whose significance derives from a range of historical, ceremonial and cultural heritage narratives conveyed by his community’s oral history. In 2005 images from this series were enlarged to a grand scale for display on billboards around Sydney as part of the exhibition 'Interesting times: Focus on Contemporary Australian Art’ curated by the MCA in Sydney. The billboard series toured to the Ten Days on an Island Festival, Tasmania and the Busan Biennale in Korea in 2006. The Portrait of a distant land series was also included in the inaugural National Indigenous Art Triennial 'Culture Warriors’ at the National Gallery of Australia (2007/2008) and the inaugural Photoquai biennale in Paris (2007).  Other significant national and international group exhibitions Maynard has participated in include: 'Urban Focus: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art from the Urban Areas of Australia’ at the NGA (1994); the 'World Retrospective on Documentary Photography’ at the Centro de la Imagen, Mexico City (1995); the Festival of the Dreaming Olympic Arts Festival, Casula Powerhouse Sydney (1997); 'Re-take: Contemporary Aboriginal &amp; Torres Strait Islander Photography’ at the NGA (1999); and 'Our Place: Indigenous Australia Now’, at the Cultural Olympiad of the Athens Olympics Games, Benaki Museum, Athens (2004). Maynard has also had numerous solo exhibitions across Australia, and his work is included in most major state gallery collections.


"
Tony McGillick,"
Tony McGillick is important in Australian art both as a driver behind the eponymous Central Street Gallery and for his paintings. Influenced by hard edge American abstraction, McGillick’s colour field paintings were seen as the forefront of the internationalism of Australian art replacing earlier parochial movements.
Named after two of his then communist parents’ heroes, Antonov Carlyle McGillick was born in Sydney in 1941. Later in life, Tony (as he was known) said “My childhood was very happy” (Tony McGillick quoted in Throsby and McCarter, 1992, p. 60). He wandered around Kings Cross barefoot, played in Trumper Park and caught the tram to swim at Redleaf Pool in Double Bay, Sydney.
In 1958 he started studying at the Julian Ashton Art School. McGillick also worked in advertising which he continued to do for the rest of his life.
In 1960 he went to London where he stayed for six years. During this period, McGillick participated in group exhibitions in London, Edinburgh and Frankfurt. After a short period in New York, he returned to Sydney in 1965.
McGillick’s pivotal period was the Central Street years. In April 1966, together with Harold Noritis and John White (his half-brother), he opened Central Street Gallery. This was Sydney’s first 'white box’ gallery and while a diverse group of artists exhibited there, many were 'colour field’ painters. He had a joint exhibition with Roy Harpur and Rollin Schlicht in August/September 1966 and in 1968, his first one-man exhibition which was also shown at Pinacotheca in Melbourne. While McGillick’s paintings could appear to be simple areas of colour, there was much more to them. On his studio wall he had a postcard of Titian’s work A Man with a Quilted Sleeve . He drew the outline of a five sided geometric shape based on the sleeve. This is the shape of each panel in Jasper’s Gesture . This work is held in the collection of the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney.
In 1968, he exhibited in 'The Field’ at the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, which was later shown in Sydney. This exhibition introduced McGillick’s work to a wider public.
In 1970, Central Street Gallery closed but the space continued to be used by the Institute of Contemporary Art for exhibitions. In 1971, he was involved in the magazine, Other Voices .
McGillick continued to participate in various group exhibitions until 1973 but largely stopped exhibiting. He continued to paint and unstretched draped canvas works replaced his irregularly shaped geometric canvases.
In 1978, he had a one-man exhibition at the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, titled 'Survey 6 Tony McGillick’ but after this his work was rarely shown. In 1990 his work was included in the exhibition 'Central Street – An exhibition of selected paintings’ at the Charles Nodrum Gallery in Melbourne which was also shown at Sydney’s Ray Hughes Gallery in 1991. In the catalogue essay, McGillick was described as the “main source of (Central Street’s) intellectual and physical energy” (McGillick, 1990).
In the early 1990s, McGillick started to think about exhibiting again and was planning an exhibition at Sherman Galleries (Sydney) but this was unrealised due to his sudden death on 3rd November 1992.
Instead in 1993, Sherman Galleries had a memorial exhibition and another one-man exhibition was held at Annandale Galleries in 2000.

Clement Meadmore,"
While Clement Meadmore (b. Melbourne, 1929) now enjoys international fame for his sculpture, in the mid-20th century his Australian reputation was centred around his work in furniture. 
Meadmore began tertiary study at the Melbourne Technical College (now the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology) in 1946.   In 1948, the college became the first in Australia to offer a formal industrial design course to service Victoria’s powerful postwar manufacturing base. Meadmore soon began taking courses in this area of study.   
By 1949, Clement Meadmore was promoting himself as an industrial designer.  By 1952, he had designed his first success – a corded black steel dining chair wrapped with synthetic fibre cord (available in red, blue, green, yellow, black and white) – under the banner of Meadmore Originals, 86 Collins Street, Melbourne.   
Meadmore’s corded dining chair was celebrated, appearing in design features and on magazine covers throughout the 1950s. In 1953, the chair received the “Good Design Award” from the Good Design Society, Sydney.   Marion Hall Best’s showrooms in Woollahra and Rowe Street, Sydney, showed the dining chair (with arms) in saddle leather as well as the coloured cord. A Meadmore corded recliner in the same style appeared in the same year, followed by a dining table with silver ash top in the same style.  It was a productive era for him.
In 1956, he formed a short-lived partnership with Max Robinson (Meadmore & Robinson) and later in the same year he became involved in a celebrated commission with the painter Leonard French for the Legend Espresso and Milk Bar at 239 Bourke Street, Melbourne (demolished 1970).  This cafe, previously known as the Anglo American Milk Bar, was owned by Ion Nicolades, who commissioned Meadmore to design a new interior.  Meadmore invited Leonard French to paint seven panels for the Milk Bar on the theme of the Legend of Sinbad.  The Legend was a deep and narrow interior that Meadmore enhanced by placing mirrors opposite each of French’s paintings. A dramatic terrazzo floor, coloured fibreglass-topped stools, diagonally-hung fluorescent lamps and a window display of a Meadmore-designed sculpture drawn from the silhouette of Sinbad’s ship (as it appeared in French’s painting no. 3) made the Legend one of Melbourne’s most visually exciting cafes.
The Legend reopened at a time when Melbourne, goaded by architect and newspaper columnist Robin Boyd and his sympathisers, struggled to modernise itself for the anticipated international visitors for the 1956 Olympics. 
Victorian industrial designers were rewarded with an inaugural 1956 Melbourne Olympics Arts Festival intended to display the cultural riches of the host nation. It was the first Olympics to incorporate an arts festival rather than art competitions. Major venues were chosen throughout the city to display Australian and Victorian achievements in industrial design, painting, architecture and other media. The Melbourne Technical College (now the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology) featured graphic and industrial design and included Meadmore’s lighting design amongst designers such as Grant Featherston, Carl Nielsen and Frances Burke.  Unfortunately, Meadmore’s work was not illustrated in the catalogue.
By the later 1950s, Meadmore had begun to actively exhibit his sculpture and move within the Melbourne gallery milieu.     He also came into contact with Max Hutchinson, a commercial furniture manufacturer and designer.  Hutchinson  (1925-99) said in a 1984 interview that Meadmore came to him in 1958 and said, “ '[T]hese artists that you like [to use in interior design commissions], they need an exhibition’,  ... So he ran the Gallery [A] for a couple of years until my accountant said, look, if you go on with this, you’ll be broke in another year.” 
Max Hutchinson went on to found a branch of Gallery A in Sydney before Meadmore encouraged him to migrate to New York City in 1968. One of Meadmore’s first 1959 shows at Gallery A, Melbourne,  featured his own sculpture with a catalogue and  essay  by  Bill Hannan.  The designer also sold a line of  'Gallery A Contract Furniture’ (“Designed to serve the discriminating, by Clement Meadmore for the coordinated series by Gallery A contract furniture.”)   This new work was now fabricated for the commercial furniture market, rather than the domestic consumer.
Although he had been pursuing his sculpture throughout the 1950s, Meadmore vigorously expanded this career in this media in 1960 and moved to Sydney. He exhibited sculpture at Macquarie Galleries and Clune Galleries, Sydney; was awarded  a commission for a sculptured balustrade for the Town House Hotel, Canberra; and briefly taught sculpture at the National Art School, Sydney. 
His industrial design work of the 1950s gave way to sculpture. In 1963, a 13 minute documentary film titled Clement Meadmore was directed by a young Bruce Beresford and narrated by John Bell with a jazz soundtrack by Tony Curby Trio + 1. In this film showing Meadmore at work, the narrator explains that “Meadmore trained as a furniture designer…” and reflects that  “Meadmore has no preconception of final work in his sculpture; he relies on inspiration for final form … The object is created first and then the [public] taste for it… This is the nature of artistic innovation…”.
Meadmore is described by Ken Scarlett in Australian Sculptors 1830-1977 as an Art Director for the fledgling editions of Australian Vogue, first published in Sydney in 1959. But a search through their first quarterly editions from 1959-1963 does not show his name on the masthead and more research is needed in this area. It is possible that he did some design and styling work for them as some of his furniture appears in an issue in the Summer 1960 edition and their Christmas 1961 edition suggests some of Meadmore’s graphic qualities.
In 1963, Meadmore moved to New York. Although his sculpture was foremost after he went to the United States, he maintained his Australian design links through Michael Hirst, a furniture designer and manufacturer working in Melbourne.
Michael Hirst, (b. 1917) ran a factory in Melbourne and remained active in furniture from 1955 to 1983. During this time, Hirst manufactured his own work as well as Meadmore items under the trademark H-Line and H/Flex. He sold through outlets like George’s, Andersons and interior decorators in Melbourne. It is not clear precisely when he began to fabricate Meadmore’s furniture. In a telephone interview in 1997, Michael Hirst explained that he too exhibited some of his design work at Gallery A, Melbourne. Some of Hirst’s work from the late 1950s has stylistic parallels with Meadmore’s work but after he left for Sydney, and later the USA, the influences wane. However, Hirst released a coffee table by Meadmore in 1965, suggesting that their commercial association continued after the designer had moved to the United States.
Although he single-mindedly pursued sculpture in the United States, Meadmore continued his interest in furniture design and in 1974 he published The Modern Chair, an illustrated survey of contemporary furniture from the Thonet Brothers to Mario Bellini.   In his 1974 introduction, Meadmore reveals something of his own aesthetics of furniture. “Each chair…[in this book] has been selected for qualities that we can assess from our standpoint today, qualities which have less to do with style and period than with a solution of a defined problem.  ...[However] Some of the finer adjustments of proportion, left unresolved by the mere solving of functional problems, have often been made with a visual sensitivity which undoubtedly contributes to make a chair a delightful object…”.  
When the book was reissued in 1997, Meadmore pronounced himself disappointed with the designs of the last quarter of the 20th century. “...[W]hen I considered updating the book I realised that I could not think of a single chair to add. I still believe that a designer who is not solving problems is a stylist, and styling is what we have been looking at for the last quarter of the century.’ 
Meadmore’s furniture work studiously avoided  historical references, although there were affinities with the 1950s furniture of the sculpture Isamu Noguchi and other mid-century sculptors who enjoyed exploring spatial problems. Meadmore favoured experimentation in synthetic fibres, plywood, finishes, steel alloys and other metals. It is clear that the designer found the techniques of fabrication interesting only as exercises in problem solving; craft values had no interest for him.  As he states clearly in his book on modern furniture, Meadmore considers that problem solving is at the centre of good furniture design. His design work in Australia suggests that a very interesting furniture designer was lost to sculpture.

Danie Mellor,"
Dr Danie Mellor, mixed media/conceptual artist was born in Mackay, Queensland in 1971. He began creating art at the age of 19 when he enrolled at the North Adelaide School of Art, gaining a Certificate in Art in 1991. Mellor then went on to study at the Canberra School of Art, Australian National University (ANU) where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts (Visual) with Honours in 1992 and received the ANU Award in 1994. In 1995 Mellor was accepted into the Birmingham Institute of Art and Design, University of Central England, UK where he gained a Masters in Fine Art in 1996. Mellor completed his study when was awarded a PhD from the School of Art at the National Institute of Art at ANU in 2004.Mellor’s work is varied. He produces landscapes using the mediums of print, drawing and painting but also employs the mediums of ceramics, glass, steel and wood. His work often addresses the entangled histories of Australia’s Indigenous, Colonial and Settler communities and in an interview with the author, Mellor stated that his work “investigates cultural differences in perception and the reading of objects in gallery contexts.”Mellor has participated in many of Australia’s art awards including 2001’s “The Art of Place – the Heritage Commission’s Art Award”, held at Old Parliament House, Canberra; The National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award, held each year at the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory, Darwin; and the Fremantle Print Prize and Exhibition. In 2003 Mellor’s work was included in the Queensland Art Gallery’s landmark exhibition, “Story Place – the art of Cape York and the Rainforest” and in 2005 curator Felicity Fenner invited Mellor to show several installation pieces in “Primavera” at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney. Mellor exhibited twice in 2006 in the exhibitions “Voyages of Recovery or An Ongoing Catalogue with Moments of Reason from the Cabinet”, Canberra Museum and Art Gallery and “In memories lie fragile dreams” at Solander Gallery, Canberra. Mellor’s work, including the large installation The contrivance of a vintage wonderland (A magnificent flight of curious fancy for science buffs … a china ark of seductive whimsy … a divinely ordered special attraction … upheld in multifariousness), was included in Culture Warriors, the inaugural National Indigenous Art Triennial at the National Gallery of Australia in 2007.Mellor’s most recognised works to date are a 2002 mezzotint engraving titled, Atherton in the Tablelands, another mezzotint engraving from 2003 titled Cyathea Cooperi, an earthenware slip cast dog, Kultur Hund, also 2003 and the Blue and White Kangaroo Series in 2007. His work is included in a number of major national and state collections including the National Gallery of Australia, the Queensland Art Gallery, the National Gallery of Victoria and the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory among others.Mellor has worked with and been encouraged by a number of notable artists and arts workers including Petr Herel, Diane Fogwell, Djon Mundine, Fiona Foley, Nigel Lendon, Patsy Payne and Michael Eather. At the time of writing Mellor was lecturing at the Sydney College of Art, Rozelle and dividing his time between Sydney and his home in Canberra.

"
Archie Moore,"
Multi-media artist, Archie Moore was born in Toowoomba, Queensland, in 1970 and remained in the Darling Downs region until 1989. He was named after Archie Moore, the African American world boxing champion of the 1950s and 1960s. Growing up in rural Queensland taught Moore about racism and the forms it can take; he was often the target of racist taunts in the school playground. This harsh childhood experience led Moore to develop a keen interest in language and how it is constructed, used and valued as a cultural medium. He completed a Certificate in Art and Design at Gateway TAFE, Eagle Farm, in 1991 and a Bachelor of Arts in Visual Arts at Queensland University of Technology in 1998. With a sound knowledge of the technical aspects of visual art presentation and a curiosity of language, Moore investigated the words used against him as a child in the body of work, Words I Learnt From The English Class (2002). Here Moore employed the words that were used to abuse, attack and insult him racially. For example in the work Onomatopoeia, Moore has painted the word “Boong”, and it appears to vibrate on the canvas. He described this work as a reference to a popular joke told to him during his school days (that 'boong’ is the sound an Aborigine makes when it hits the bull bar of your car). Furthermore the word, he says, describes “the jolt that went through my body when realising the nature of these 'humorous jokes’” (http://www.redbubble.com/people/archiemoore/art/125503-9-onomatopoeia, accessed 19 Sept 2008).In his work Scripta Continua 1,2,3,4, shown at the State Library of Queensland 2005 exhibition, “CALD“, Moore investigates words that are made up of at least two other words and places laser-cut foam core letters into a sentence with the 'spaces’ removed. The installation reads 'THERAPIST NOWHERE TOGETHER BRAINWASHERS’. The work challenges the viewer to make sense of it by spacing the words differently. For example, the work could become 'THE RAPIST NOW HERE TO GET HER BRAIN WAS HERS’. Of course this newly constructed sentence does not have a clear meaning either; in conversation with the author (January 2009), MCA curator Glenn Barkley agreed that it could be just this effect that Moore is playing with – challenging the viewer to re-write, to re-construct and to come to an understanding at how easily the English language can be manipulated. Moore’s fascination with the English language and how it has affected him as an Aboriginal man has been developed even further in his 2007 body of work titled Maltheism (which was short-listed in Queensland Art Gallery’s 2008 Xstrata Coal Emerging Indigenous Art Award) in which a series of bibles of various sizes lay open at certain key passages. In doing so, Moore is offering a commentary on the Mission Days that were instrumental to Australia’s colonization. From these pages Moore has constructed miniature churches so that the bibles in fact become sculptural works. In one such work the bible is open at Deuteronomy, where the passage, 'Destruction of Pagans’ is displayed. This passage talks of invasions of other lands, the taking of the new land’s resources, the killing of all the men and of making no treaty with the people. Conceptually Moore is commenting on the destruction of Aboriginal spirituality, ceremony and cultural practices by the government policy of rounding up Aboriginal people and forcing them to live on Christian missions, attend church services and praise an alien god. Of this biblical passage Moore has said that he thought “it was a similar genocidal mindset of the First Fleet and also of the invading Christian nations in the Middle East in more recent times, i.e. the Iraq Wars” (http://www.redbubble.com/people/archiemoore/art/125523-9-maltheism, accessed 19 Sept 2008). In a 2008 conversation with the author, University of Newcastle academic Dr Romaine Moreton said 'The written word is fundamental to the creation of social space, informing how physical bodies are identified and become identifiable and Moore’s work makes that connection between the written word and the construction of physical space, alluding to the construction of identities.’Moore was the recipient of the 2001 Anne and Gordon Samstag International Visual Arts Scholarship which enabled him to travel to the Czech Republic to study at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague. In 2005 he obtained a residency and exhibition through the NEWflames program at Fireworks Gallery. In 2008 he was a finalist in both the Telstra Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award at the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory and the Xstrata Coal Emerging Indigenous Art Award at the Gallery of Modern Art, Queensland Art Gallery.  He has exhibited in many group and solo shows including “Nympholepsy – A survey of 'Love’ works”, Palace Gallery, Brisbane (2005); “The Dark and the Light”, Fireworks Gallery (2005); “Crossings: A Gathering of Artists” SomArts Gallery, San Francisco (2005); “Depth of Field” at Ryan Renshaw Gallery (2006); “2008 Biennale of Sydney Online Venue”; “L’Aboriginal Festival de Avignon”, France (2008); and “The Revenge of Genres Contemporary Australian Art” at the Cite Internationale des Arts, Paris (2008). In 2009 Moore was living in Brisbane, Queensland.

Clinton Nain,"
Born 1971, Carlton, Victoria, of the Meriam Mer, Erub, Ugar peoples of the Torres Strait and the Ku Ku people of far North Queensland Since obtaining his Bachelor of Fine Art (Painting) at the Victorian College of the Arts (1992-94) and Master of Fine Art (Research) at the College of Fine Arts, University of New South Wales (2001-03), Clinton Nain has established a significant place in the critical debates of contemporary Australian art. Nain’s work confronts the continuing injustices suffered by the Indigenous peoples of Australia. His powerful symbolism evokes the wounds of dispossession – of country, culture and language – which lie at the heart of those who once were masters of their own destinies. Recurring images, such as his mother’s mission dress and the potholed road leading to her grave, point both to family loss and the ever-painful journey towards reconciliation and healing. In 1999, Nain began his 'White King, Blak Queen’ series exploring colonisation through a black feminine perspective. Through performance, storytelling and staining fabrics with bleach, the Blak Queen boldly quests for equality. Nain explored these ideas further in his 2001 exhibition, 'Whitens, Removes Stains, Kills Germs’.The artist’s brother, writer John Harding, has said: 'The Blak Queen is omnipotent, knows no boundaries and recognises no colonising fences. She has even transformed herself into a bird and flown out a window! She can turn everyday household items into weapons against colonisation and the fading of memory. Her splashes of bleach become evocative images of lingering memories, prodding us to remember the truth.’ (Melbourne, 2001)Nain’s work remains uncompromising. Bitumen, house paint and varnish are now his principal mediums. His exhibitions – 'Living Under the Bridge’ (2003), 'The Dirty Deal Ain’t Clean’ (2005), 'A E I O U’ (2006) and 'Hurdy Gurdy (Wrong Way Around)’ (2007) – target the ongoing marginalisation of many Aboriginal people and communities in Australia. Following the national apology to the Stolen Generations, Nain’s plea is for us to listen to the voices of the most vulnerable in seeking resolution. 'What we artists create’, he says, 'is for everyone in the world.’

Albert Namatjira,
Lorna Napurrula,"
Lorna Fencer Napurrula was born around 1924 at Yartulu Yartulu, and is custodian of land called Yummurrpa, south of the Granites Mine in the Tanami Desert in the Northern Territory. The Yarla (Yam) Dreaming track originates from this region and travels north towards Lajamanu. In 1949, along with many Warlpiri people, Lorna Napurrula was forcibly transported to the government settlement of Lajamanu at Hookers Creek, in the country of the Gurindji people, 400 kilometres north of their own country near Yuendumu. Despite being uprooted from her traditional land, Lorna nevertheless maintained her cultural identity through ceremonial activity and art, and asserted her position as a prominent elder and teacher in the Lajamanu community. She was also a member of the artist’s co-operative in Lajamanu, the Warnayaka Art Centre.
Until her death in December 2006, Lorna lived predominantly at Lajamanu and Katherine (650 kilometres apart), travelling regularly between them. She was a senior Lajamanu artist. Lorna was custodian of the Caterpillar (luju) and Bush Potato (yarla) Dreamings that are associated with that land. She was also custodian of Dreamings associated with bush onion, yam and also bush tomato, bush plum, ngalatji (little white flower), many different seeds and water, wallaby and certain men’s stories including boomerangs for the Napurrula, Nakamarra, Japurrula, and Jakamarra skin groups. The travels of Napurrula and Nakamarrra moiety or “skin” groups were the inspiration for Lorna’s work.
While raised as a skilled painter of decorative body designs for ceremonies, Lorna began painting on canvas in 1986 with a typical dotting technique. She soon developed a very unique, personal style which became increasingly free, bold and abstract. Lorna applied the paint in liberal quantities to the brush before touching down on the canvas and layering the colours, one upon the next. The thick impasto, which may be produced with acrylic paint, was a crucial factor in her work as were bright, clear colour ranging from intense oranges to pinks, blues and lime greens. Lorna also mastered another quite different style where she relied on an expressive linear gesture as her elongated marks swirled across the surface of the canvas.
Her first solo exhibition was in 1997 and since then she exhibited regularly in solo as well as in group exhibitions. Lorna’s work is represented in public galleries in Australia and in private galleries both in Australia and overseas.

Paddy Jupurrurla Nelson,"
Born c. 1919 at Napanangkajarra near Yuendumu, Paddy Nelson’s country ran from Yumurrpa to Watikinpirri area, SW of Yuendumu through New Haven station. A Warlpiri speaker, Paddy was a senior ceremonial and religious leader in the Yuednumu community. He was one of the first Yuendumu men to paint with acrylics, and one of the senior men who painted the doors of the school in 1983. With Paddy SIMS, Larry SPENCER Jungarrayi and JIMIJA Jungarrayi, he worked on the 1985 Star Dreaming painting whose purchase by the Australian National Gallery from the Yuendumu artists’ first show in the eastern states, helped to launch the new painting enterprise in the local art world. His main site was Ngama, a Snake Dreaming place. He painted Yarla (Big Yam) and Ngarlajiyi (Small Yam), Warna (Snake), Ngapa (Water), Karrku (Mt Stanley ochre mines), Janganpa (Possum), Mukaki (Bush Plum), Karnta (Women’s) and Watijarra (Two Men) Dreamings. A prolific painter, distinctive for his fluid impulsive brushwork and subtly different renderings of his classic iconography, his work was shown in almost every exhibition of Warlukurlangu Artists from the mid ’80s onwards and in major touring exhibitions of Aboriginal art including Art and Aboriginality (Portsmouth Festival 1987, Sydney Opera House 1988 – Paddy Nelson’s painting appears on the cover of the catalogue) and Dreamings: The Art of Aboriginal Australia (New York, Chicago, Los Angeles etc. 1989-90). In 1988, Paddy Nelson was one of five Warlpiri men from Yuendumu selected by the Power Gallery, Sydney University, to travel to Paris to create a ground painting installation at the exhibition Magiciens de la Terre at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris in May 1989. Several of Paddy’s relatives, including his wife Daisy NELSON and her sons Michael Jagamara NELSON and Bronson Jakamarra NELSON, are also artists of reknown.

Helmut Newton,
Mandy Nicholson,"
Born in August 1975 in Healesville, Victoria, Mandy Nicholson is of the Woi wurrrung language group of the Wurundjeri-willam clan of the Kulin Nation of people from Melbourne. Always interested in visual art, Nicholson began drawing as a child, developing her skills into painting. In 1993 while in Year 12 at school, Nicholson began creating what she has described as “Aboriginal art” in art classes, encouraged by her teacher who was aware of her cultural heritage. In 1994 she began studying art at various institutions including Monash University (where she was enrolled in a “Koorie Studies” course), Swinburne and RMIT TAFE Colleges and her local Community Development Employment Program (CDEP). These institutions introduced her to the media of carving, printmaking (including etching) and ceramics, and also to clothing production and small business training. All her work is informed by designs and stories of her people incorporating her own interpretations. Her paintings are created by the use of synthetic polymer on water-colour paper and sometimes canvas board. In correspondence with the author in September 2008, Nicholson said “the stories behind my designs all revolve around nature, animals and stories of my people, personal experience and my two daughters. I always incorporate traditional imagery into all my pieces.” She sold her first work of art, Marla’s (wallabies) Grazing, (acrylic on canvas) in 1994 to a private collector.Nicholson’s first solo exhibition “Artworks by Mandy Nicholson” was held in 2001 at the Koorie Heritage Trust in Melbourne. In 2002 her work Welcome to Melbourne was projected around Manchester Stadium during the Closing Ceremony of the 2002 Manchester Commonwealth Games. Since 2002 she has participated in a number of group exhibitions including “Mission Voices” at the Koorie Heritage Trust (2004), the inaugural “Gumbri-White Dove Art Competition Exhibition” (which she won) at Bundoora Homestead (2004), “She Who Dreams” at Walker Street Gallery (2007) and “Moving Pictures” at Manningham Gallery (2008), which she also curated.The Yarra River (Birrarung) is a constant theme throughout her work as it is the Birrarung creation story that is one of the most important for her people. Nicholson has worked as a waitress, sales representative, secretary, shop manager, cultural resource officer and muralist and in 2006 she was commissioned to work collaboratively on one public art installation, Common Ground, at Birrarung Marr public parklands in Melbourne. She was also commissioned to create her first solo public artwork kirrip wurrung biik (friend, mouth, country) for the Wyndham Cultural Centre in Werribee. The Common Ground installation consisted of cast-iron spears and air-chiselled boulders and kirrip wurrung biik employs the use of sand-blasted black limestone. While Common Ground encompassed the story of Bunjil (the Eagle) the creator and his helpers, kirrip wurrung biik focuses on the story of the Kulin Nation that the Wurundjeri people are a part of. Nicholson’s work is held in the permanent collections of the National Gallery of Australia, the Manningham Gallery, Bundoora Homestead, the Aboriginal Community Elders Service and the Aboriginal Catholic Ministry. Nicholson lives and works in Melbourne, Victoria.

Trevor Nickolls,"
Trevor Nickolls was born in Adelaide, South Australia, in 1949. He first exhibited as a student and gained a Diploma of Fine Art from the South Australian School of Art in 1972. One of his teachers was the printmaker Franz Kempf. In 1978 he undertook a diploma in education which enabled him to work as a school art teacher. In 1979, when undertaking postgraduate studies at the Victorian College of the Arts  he met the Papunya artist Dinny Nolan.  He later described this as a turning point in his art, and in his life as Nolan mentored him in gaining an understanding of the directions his art could take.
 The following year, after graduating with a postgraduate diploma of painting, he was appointed an education officer. This meant that he was able to travel through the Northern Territory, meeting artists and coming to see how modern the ancient techniques could appear to be. His own art changed to incorporate his new understanding of a changing tradition of Aboriginal art.In the 1980s he lived in both Sydney and Melbourne, and began to paint the awkward duality of the changing perception. It was the works of the 1980s, that showed the awkwardness and pain of Aboriginal people responding to a rapidly changing world and the growth of industrialisation, which finally brought him widespread critical acclaim. He coined the catch phrase, “Dreamtime to Machinetime” to sum up both the dilemma and the response. Dreamtime is the harmonious connection to nature and ancient traditions, while Machinetime is the trap of the modern confined life.
In 1990 Nickolls joined Rover Thomas to become the first Aboriginal artists to represent Australia at the Venice Biennale. His work was widely collected by  many institutions including the National Gallery of Australia, Queensland Art Gallery, the Art Gallery of South Australia, the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory, the National Gallery of Victoria and the Art Gallery of New South Wales.
He was well aware of the gifts that art could bring. His last gift was to establish the Trevor Nickolls Art Award for Aboriginal artists can undertake studies at art school.After his death, his friend the artist Vernon Ah Kee wrote: “For Blackfellas like me, the work of Trevor Nickolls, in the 1970s and ‘80s was a visual language that gave voice to the confusion and complexity around the identity politics of the times. As a visual artist, he gave voice to our frustration and anger at our powerlessness and our invisibility like no artist before had.”
On 17 November 2012 the Art Gallery of South Australia held a public commemoration of his life.


"
Sidney Nolan,"
Sidney Nolan was born on  22 April 1917, the first of four children of a Melbourne tram driver, Sidney Nolan, and his wife Dora Sutherland. His parents were Australian born, but very aware of their Irish cultural heritage. Later that year the family moved to the seaside suburb of St Kilda, elements of which were later to feature in Nolan’s mature art.In 1932 Nolan left school at the standard leaving age of 14 and enrolled in design and crafts at Prahran Technical College. The next year he began working for Fayrefield Hats where he produced advertising and display stands. This technical work gave him an early introduction to spray paints and experimental use of materials. In 1934 he enrolled in evening classes at the National Gallery School and within a few years was making plein air paintings within the Victorian impressionist tradition. His interest in art and ideas led him on a more adventurous path. In 1938 he met the art patrons John and Sunday Reed and through his involvement with them became a founding member of Victoria’s Contemporary Art Society. The same year he married fellow art student, Elizabeth Paterson, the grand-daughter of the artist John Ford Paterson and moved to Ocean Grove near Barwon Heads. In 1939 Nolan saw the Herald Exhibition of English and European Contemporary Art, which introduced him to the art of 20th century Europe and radicalised his own approach to art. His first solo exhibition in 1940 was opened by John Reed. The same year Nolan’s daughter, Amelda, was born.The following year Nolan left his family to live with the Reeds at their home at Heide Park. He remained romantically involved with Sunday Reed until 1947 and she actively encouraged him to take a more experimental approach with his art. He began to use Ripolin enamel paint, material more commonly used by house painters. Its fluidity and rapid drying enabled him to freely experiment with different styles and to quickly paint more than one work at a time.  He was drawn into the activities of the Reeds, Max Harris and the Angry Penguins group, and in 1944 painted a series of paintings in response to the poems of the bq). naivebq). poet, Ern Malley. After an issue of the Angry Penguins magazine celebrated the genius of Malley (with a cover illustration by Nolan) the poet was revealed to be a hoax concocted by two anti-modernist poets. The entry of Japan into World War II led to Australia conscripting soldiers for the first time in its history. Nolan was conscripted and posted to the Wimmera in rural Victoria. Two years later,faced with the possibility of being posted to New Guinea, he deserted the Army and took refuge with the Reeds at their Heide and Parkville homes. Living a fugitive life may have turned his mind to the circumstances of other fugitives from justice. Douglas Stewart’s radio play in verse, Ned Kelly, was broadcast in 1942, but Nolan never admitted Stewart as a possible source for his Ned Kelly series which emerged in the second half of the decade. These paintings remain his most memorable work and he continually returned to this subject matter throughout his career.In 1947 Nolan left Sunday Reed and her husband John to live with John’s sister Cynthia who was already establishing a reputation as a sensitive writer. They moved to Sydney where the new gallery director, Hal Missingham, was an active supporter of Nolan’s work. Their house at Wahroonga backed onto the property of the conservative artist Lionel Lindsay. When Lindsay observed Nolan’s practice of painting a row of paintings all at once he wrote to his friend Harold Wright, angrily denouncing Nolan as a charlatan. In 1948, he put his affairs in order, obtained a dishonourable discharge from the Army,and married Cynthia. The couple made several flights over outback Australia,and Nolan began his remarkable series of aerial paintings of the outback, where thin wiped layers of Ripolin are used to evoke the shapes of ragged mountains.In 1951 they left for Europe and in 1953 they settled permanently in London, but made frequent visits to other parts of Europe, Africa, Antarctica and often returned to Australia. The London base was essential to establishing Nolan’s British reputation. He was honoured with a survey exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery in 1957, the same year as he created the set designs for the stage version of Douglas Stewart’s Ned Kelly play. He was awarded a Harkness Fellowship to the USA in 1959 and in 1963 was awarded an OBE for his services to art. Many retrospective exhibitions were to follow, including a 1967 exhibition at the Art Gallery of New South Wales, a 1973 exhibition in Dublin and a 1987 national touring exhibition in Australia.Cynthia Nolan committed suicide on 23 November 1976. In 1978 Nolan married Mary Boyd Perceval, the widow of artist John Perceval and sister of his friend Arthur Boyd. The relative haste of this marriage caused a permanent rift with his former friend Patrick White, who attacked him in his memoir Flaws in the Glass. Nolan responded in paint.In 1981 he was made a Knight Bachelor for his services to art, and in 1983 they settled at Rodd Farm on the borders of Wales where he enjoyed the expansive landscape for the rest of his life. While he was honoured by Australian galleries with exhibitions in the later years, he was emotionally more committed to Britain and Ireland. In 1986, four years before his death, he gave fifty paintings to the people of Ireland.


"
Dinny Tjampitjinpa Nolan,"
Dinny’s date of birth has been put as far back as 1922 or even earlier and as far forward as 1944. The artist said that he survived the Coniston massacre of 1928, which would lend credence to the earlier date. He was born close to present-day Yuendumu and spent many years working as a stockman across the Territory before settling in Papunya in the mid ’70s. A senior custodian for the Warlpiri people, he is officially recognised as leader of rainmaking and Water Dreaming ceremonies and is well-known for his powerful singing voice. Encouraged by his cousins Clifford Possum and Billy Stockman , and 'brother’ Kaapa Tjampitjinpa , Dinny joined the painting group in the mid 1970s. In 1977 he travelled to Melbourne for a show of Papunya Tula Artists at the Realities Gallery, staying with artist Trevor Nickolls. In 1981 Dinny visited Sydney with Paddy Carroll to construct one of the first sand paintings seen outside of Central Australia. The same year he executed a print at the Victorian Print Workshop. In 1988 he and Maxie Tjampitjinpa were Artists-in-Residence at the Wagga Wagga City Art Gallery. He also painted for the Centre for Aboriginal Artists in Alice Springs during the late 1980s and 1990s. His Dreamings include Water, Willy Willy, Pelican, Bush Turkey, Emu, Goanna and Bushfire.

"
Justin O'Brien,"
Justin O’Brien, born 2 August 1917, was the third of the the five surviving children of the produce merchant Maurice O’Brien and his Irish-born wife, Teresa Mary Sherin. At the time, Hurstville, south of Sydney, was a semi-rural small town. In this devoutly religious family, life was dominated by the parish Catholic Church.When he was six he stayed with relatives in Elizabeth Bay where his aunt Louise gave him art materials. While at school at Christian Brothers Waverley he took private lessons with Edward M. Smith, and at the age of 14 he left school to study with Smith full time. By the time he was 18 O’Brien was teaching art in Catholic schools, while developing his own practice. He exhibited in the Archibald Prize in 1937, 1938 and 1939. His work attracted the interest of the Sydney Morning Herald’s Art Critic, Peter Bellew, and Peter Dodd, an art teacher. They encouraged him to join the fledgling Contemporary Art Society and the religious painting group, the Fra Angelico Guild.
Much of O’Brien’s artistic development is indebted to his experiences in Europe. His experiences abroad began in 1940 during WWII as part of the Australia Army Medical Corps. First in Palestine and then in German-occupied Greece, where he nursed seriously injured soldiers. Although a majority of his war-time artwork was completed in a prisoner-of-war camp in Torun, Poland, it was in Greece that he witnessed a sight that greatly impacted his artistic style: a mass grave of Greek civilian victims of famine. This experience overwhelmed young O’Brien who, upon his return to Australia, introduced symbolism into his painting to express what he saw in ' the Greek Burial’ (c1945) by employing a bright, simple palate with stylized figures and landscape.
O’Brien’s return from war saw great support from private patrons and Macquarie Galleries, at which he exhibited repeatedly throughout his career. Just as important were the friendships he developed at this time, leading him to exhibit with The Sydney Group, artists who were later mocked by Robert Hughes as the “Charm School”. By 1946 he was living at Meriloola, the grand but slightly decrepit boarding house run by “Chica” Lowe which was the haunt of many actors, dancers and artists; including Donald Friend, Mary Edwards, and Loudon Sainthill.1946 also saw him appointed art master at nearby Cranbrook School, a position he held intermittently until his final departure for Europe at the end of 1966. Many of the boys became models for his paintings. Most importantly, his influence as teacher and mentor led to some of his students becoming professional artists, including Brian Dunlop, John Montefiore, Martin Sharp Owen Tooth and Peter Kingston.
Over his lifetime of painting, O’Brien’s art embraces and readdresses several motifs including moonlit figures, male bathers, Mediterranean landscapes, and religious scenes. Despite his great admiration of Cezanne, Raphael, Pierro della Francesca, El Greco and the Sienese painter Duccio, his style and use of colour has been attributed as being Symbolist and Fauvist. The intense but unconventional use of religious iconography in his art led O’Brien to be awarded the inaugural Blake Prize for religious art in 1951.In 1954 O’Brien renounced the Catholicism of his youth, but s spiritual element remained in his art.
From 1948 until 1965 O’Brien paid several extended visits to Greece and Italy. At the end of 1966 he resigned from Cranbrook and in early 1967 resettled in Italy. The following year he was commissioned to create a mosaic for the Basilica of the Annunciation at Nazareth. Egidio Scardamaglia, one of his pupils posed for the angel. In Rome Scardamaglia with his wife and daughters became O’Brien’s new family.
His later works reflect the sun-drenched tranquility of his new life. He continued to exhibit in Sydney, at Macquarie Galleries, until his death. In 1982 the art historian Anthony Bradley, who he had taught at Cranbrook, wrote a monograph on his art. In 1987, the year he turned 70, he was honoured with retrospective exhibitions at the National Gallery of Victoria and the S.H. Ervin Gallery in Sydney. He was awarded an AM in 1992.His last years were troubled by bone cancer, and he died in Rome on 17 January 1996

Chris O'Doherty,"
painter, cartoonist, illustrator and designer, is a New Zealander who came to Australia, attended the College of Fine Arts (UNSW) and became a designer for the highly successful design group Mambo. As Reg Mombassa, he has produced several very colourful, surreal and sexy publications (see SLNSW catalogue). A Mambo retrospective was held at Bathurst Regional Art Gallery in 2000. (an apocalyptic Mombassa colour print avaialble there containing numerous Bosch and other art historical references.) Mambo designed the Sydney 2000 Olympic opening ceremony uniforms for the Australian team; the jacket linings featured a Mombassa design. The firm also did the surreal vehicles and shapes that dominated the Olympic Closing Ceremony.
As a painter, O’Doherty is represented by Watters Gallery, Sydney. His work was included in John McDonald’s Federation at the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra in 2001 (and travelling).

"
Alan Oldfield,"
Alan Oldfield was born in Sydney’s industrial inner west,the son of a fitter and turner,whose success was very much a tribute to the quality of education made available to bright students in Australia in the immediate post war years. He discovered art because the local Marrickville library was designated to specialise in art books. At the age of eleven he was awarded the children’s prize in the local Rockdale Art Prize.
 By the time Oldfield started high school the family had moved to a new house in Sydney’s south-west suburban sprawl where he attended East Hills Boys High, one of the new comprehensive schools that enabled all NSW school children to complete their secondary education. Bright boys were placed in the academic stream away from art, but his  Latin teacher was Bill Collins, later to achieve national fame for his love of the cinema, so he was taught well.  Oldfield left school at the age of fourteen with his Intermediate Certificate and enrolled in the National Art School at East Sydney Technical College. This introduced Oldfield to a world of freedom away from the restrictions of the suburbs. The camaraderie between staff and students and the self-conscious bohemianism of inner Sydney took him forever away from the restrictions of the suburbs. He enjoyed a robust social life, which included several spectacular appearances at the annual artists balls. He once recalled walking down Oxford Street as dawn was breaking, wearing nothing but glitter under his coat. The teaching was however less impressive. He later told James Gleeson that he found the teaching 'absolutely appalling’. Nevertheless it enabled him to join the lively young New York influenced radical artists gathered at Sydney’s Central Street Gallery, and he first made his mark as a hard edge colour field painter with an exhibition at the recently opened Watters Gallery. In 1968 he was one of the younger artists selected for the ground-breaking The Field exhibition at the National Gallery of Victoria. Also at this time he wrote articles for the short lived art magazine, Other Voices.  Many years later, in 2000 he wrote the catalogue introduction for the Wendy Paramour catalogue. She was the only woman in the Central Street group, and he wanted to ensure that her art was not forgotten after her death.In 1970 he travelled to the USA and Europe for the first time. He had always loved saturated colour, and his initial aim was to see the great survey exhibition of Matisse in Paris. But in Europe he was confronted with the power and beauty of the whole western tradition. As a young man Oldfield had found spiritual solace in the Anglo Catholic traditions of Sydney’s Christ Church St Laurence, and this encouraged him to look more to the great aesthetic traditions of medieval and renaissance Europe. His partner,  late Jim Davenport, was an academic so the young Oldfield came to Cambridge where he later claimed he disgraced himself at High Table at Kings College.His paintings of this time included a series of meticulously painted chairs, empty, but awaiting the presence of a human body. One work included a book placed on a beach chair: it was a monograph on Caravaggio. He had seen the definitive Caravaggio and the Caravagisti exhibition in Florence and the 17th century Italian master was to remain one of his great guides. Oldfield returned to Italy in 1974, to Rome on an Australia Council Visual Arts Board travel grant. Here he had the freedom and time to paint and further study renaissance and baroque art. He began to appreciate the beauty of subtle tones and of sculptural forms shown in paint. His growing interest in medieval mysticism led to Oldfield researching The Revelations of Divine Love, by the English mystic, Dame Julian of Norwich. In 1985 he began to paint a series of works based on her visions and spirituality. His painting of Julian’s revelation A High and Spiritual Shewing of Christ’s Mother was awarded the Blake Prize in 1987. The entire cycle was exhibited in Norwich Cathedral in 1988 and his work still holds pride of place in St Julian’s Church, Norwich. Other residencies included Linacre College in Oxford, and Christchurch Cathedral Newcastle, NSW.Explorations and journeys, physical and spiritual, were a characteristic of much of his later painting.  Oldfield’s connections to spiritual values led him to being awarded the Blake Prize again in 1991 and he also painted the shrines of Our Lady and Our Lord at Christ church St Laurence in Sydney. His last major series, Lizard Island, the Journey of Mary Watson, was published as a book, with text by Suzanne Falkiner. It was a finalist in the 2002 NSW Premier’s Literary Prize.Despite his involvement with interior lives and metaphysics, Alan Oldfield  did not confine himself to religious art and ceremony. He was the designer for Rumours  and Afterworlds  for the Sydney Dance company from 1978 to 1980, and also designed Beyond Twelve for the Australian Ballet in 1987.
In 1976 Alan Oldfield joined the full-time lecturing staff at the Alexander Mackie College of Advanced Education in Sydney. He was to remain on the staff until just before his death, as the institution first renamed itself the City Art Institute and then College of Fine Arts, as part of the University of New South Wales. In 1991 he was promoted to Associate Professor.  At various times he was head of undergraduate studies, head of studio studies, honours co-ordinator, acting director of the Ivan Dougherty Gallery, and most of the other academic administrative jobs undertaken by university staff. In committee meetings his sotto voce comments were usually scandalous, and much appreciated by his colleagues.As a teacher he was well-known for getting surprising results from the least promising of students. He would say with a chuckle, comments that others would not dare utter, After the student got over the initial shock of being told they needed to totally rethink their approach, they would respond. He was an inspirational teacher of art history on Renaissance art, and his passion for the art he loved was totally infectious.After the death of Jim Davenport in 1997, Oldfield was supported by his colleagues and came to realise that this art school, and indeed the wider arts community was part of his extended family, as well as his sister, her husband and their children. Later this family included his new church of St James King Street, where he served on the Parish Council, and it was here that he was farewelled in a great Anglo Catholic Requiem Mass. He had designed the ceremony in the full and gleeful knowledge that most of those inhaling the incense were atheists.


"
Margaret Olley,"
painter, was born on 22 June 1923 in Lismore, NSW, eldest of the three children of Joseph Olley and Grace, née Temperley. Shortly after her birth the family moved to Tully in Queensland, then to Murwillumbah (NSW) before finally settling in Brisbane. Margaret was educated at Somerville House. She was taught art by Caroline Barker , an enthusiastic teacher quick to recognise ability.
She spent a year at Brisbane Central Technical College, then studied at East Sydney Tech. under Dorothy Thornhill , Jean Bellette , Lyndon Dadswell , Douglas Dundas , Herbert Badham and Frank Medworth , graduating in 1945 with first-class honours. In 1943 she painted sets for John Kay of the Mercury Theatre Group; in 1947 she designed and executed the sets for Sam Hughes’s production of J.E. Flecker’s Hassan ; in 1948 she worked with Sidney Nolan on Hughes’s production of Cocteau’s Orphée and Shakespeare’s Pericles . She began showing her paintings in group exhibitions in 1944 – at the Royal Queensland Art Society Exhibition in Brisbane and the Under Thirties Group in Sydney. By 1945 she was exhibiting with the Contemporary Art Society in Sydney. In 1948 she held her first solo exhibitions at the Macquarie Galleries, Sydney and the Morton Galleries, Brisbane, where she again exhibited in 1950. In 1947 she won the Mosman Art Prize with New England Landscape , one of many landscapes she executed at this time. She and Donald Friend were among the first of many artists to paint in the Hill End area, near Bathurst.
In 1949 Olley and Mitty Lee Brown travelled to London. Olley settled in Paris and attended classes at La Grande Chaumiére. She became interested in the work of artists such as Matisse and Bonnard, seen in commercial galleries. On weekends she and fellow Australians David Strachan and Moya Dyring made painting expeditions, which she continued after moving to a farmhouse at Cassis, near Marseilles. Her many drawings and watercolours of Paris and French coastal villages have a quick vitality and show an increased awareness of light.
Having learnt the technique from Sir Francis Rose (a fellow excursionist), her first overseas exhibition – in 1952 at the Galerie Paul Morihien, Palais Royal – was of monotypes. It was favourably reviewed in three Paris journals, all of which commented on her sense of poetry. Olley sent out bundles of drawings to Australia for exhibition at the Marodian Gallery, Brisbane, and the Macquarie Galleries. In 1952, with Strachan, she joined David Rose in Lisbon and helped him with a commission for wallpaper designs. Then she worked in London with Jocelyn Rickards and Loudon Sainthill on designs for Michael Benthall’s proposed film, The Tempest .
In 1953 Olley returned to Brisbane. Robert Haines, Director of the Queensland Art Gallery, commissioned her to paint a mural of the Place de la Concorde for the opening of the important 'French Art Today’ exhibition at the gallery. It was followed by mural commissions for the Grosvenor and Lennon’s Hotels in Brisbane and, in 1955, for the Leagues Club, Phillip Street, Sydney.
In 1954 Olley and Friend travelled to Magnetic Island, prior to visiting Papua New Guinea. Work from these trips was shown in a solo exhibition at Macquarie Galleries in 1955. They revealed an increased interest in colour and, as Lloyd Rees was to comment, showed a Bonnard-like approach to tropical landscape. The still-lifes heralded her future direction as a still-life painter.
A warm personality, Margaret Olley’s capacity for friendship and her individual style of dress has endeared her to many artists. She has been a popular subject for portraits: by Margaret Cilento , Russell Drysdale and Donald Friend, as well as the renowned 1949 Archibald prize-winning portrait by William Dobell . All state and most regional galleries in Australia hold examples of her work.


"
John Olsen,"
He was born on 21 January 1928 in Newcastle, the son of Esma Agnes (née McCubbin) and Henry Olsen, who worked at the Cooee Clothing company.  When he was seven his father was transfered to Sydney, where they lived at Bondi. Nevertheless he continued to hold deep visual memories of the industrial landscape of  Newcastle. In Sydney he attended Paddington Junior Technical High until the outbreak of World War II when his father enlisted in the Army, his mother and sister stayed with relatives at Yass, and Olsen became a boarder at St Joseph’s Hunters Hill.After obtaining his Leaving Certificate in 1943 he worked as a clerk for Elders Smith, a job he loathed. His early talent for drawing was soon turned to good purpose as he became a freelance cartoonist and illustrator for a number of Sydney based publications.His first art classes at the Julian Ashton School in 1946 were to help him develop his illustrative skills. When he wanted to learn more about life drawing so enrolled in Dattilo Rubbo’s School. This was followed by a return to the Julian Ashton School in 1950.Always convivial, Olsen began to move in the circle of artists, writers and coffee drinkers who were congregating around Rowe Street as a sort of Sydney bohemia (many of these would later form the nucleus of “The Push”. He came to know Carl Plate’s Rowe Street Notanda Gallery with its art books and reproductions of European modern art. He decided to become a serious artist.He was aided in his ambition by the difficult but brilliant teacher, John Passmore, who taught at the Julian Ashton Art School from 1950 to 1954. In his old age Olsen recalled Passmore’s uncompromising rigour and his non-precious approach to materials. Olsen also took classes at East Sydney Technical College with the less bombastic Godfrey Miller. The 1950s was a time of renewed prosperity after the trauma of War and economic Depression. Young radical students, like Olsen, were keen to stake their claim as leaders of the avant garde. In 1953 he led a student demonstration against the conservative Trustees of the National Art Gallery of New South Wales, and was quoted in the press criticising the awarding of the Archibald Prize to William Dargie. Over two decades later, Olsen was himself seen as one of the more conservative Trustees of the same institution.In 1956 his work was selected for the prestigious Contemporary Australian paintings : Pacific Loan Exhibition on board Orient Line S.S. Orcades , an exhibition that took what was seen as the best Australian art on an ocean cruise as a form of cultural exchange. In December of the same year, Olsen joined with John Passmore, Ralph Balson, Robert Klippel, Eric Smith and William Rose in a group exhibition at Macquarie Galleries – Direction 1 . This exhibition was later credited with bringing Abstract Expressionism to Australia, although, with the exception of Klippel, none of the artists involved had any real knowledge of contemporary art activities in other countries.Olsen’s paintings, some based on moody readings of T.S.Eliot, so impressed the art critic of the Sydney Morning Herald, Paul Haefliger, that he encouraged the Sydney businessman Robert Shaw, to give him a private scholarship to Europe, on condition that he not be based in the UK. Instead he went to Paris, where he spent some months in 1957 learning etching in S.W. Hayter’s Atelier 17 Workshop in Paris, before travelling to Spain. By July 1958 he was in Majorca, where he based himself in a house in Deya to paint. He also worked as an apprentice chef, and developed a life long love of Mediterranean food, both its flavours and its appearance.The distilled essence of these Spanish years continued to flavour his art on his return to Sydney in 1960. Olsen’s paintings of the 1960s established him as one of the leading artists of his generation. He painted Spanish Encounter (Now in the collection of the Art Gallery of New South Wales)shortly after his return while living in Victoria Street  Woolloomooloo, in  loose-knit creative community with many of Sydney’s leading younger artists. Later he stayed for some month’s at Paul Haefliger’s former house in the old gold mining town of Hill End, before eventually settling at Watson’s Bay with his young family. This was the seascape that inspired Entrance to the Seaport of Desire and other works, although these paintings were also celebrations of the hedonism of Sydney life. Even though he was now lauded as a major Australian artist, Olsen did not earn enough from his art to support his family, so supplemented his income by teaching at East Sydney Technical College, Desiderius Orban’s school, the Mary White Art School and lectured to Architecture students at the University of New South Wales. In 1968 he ran his own art school at the Bakery Art School, but this only lasted a year. In 1969 the Olsen family moved to Clifton Pugh’s collective of artists at Dunmoochin in Victoria. On their return to Sydney in 1971, Olsen bought a large property at Dural, north-west of Sydney,and here built a large house and studio. This was the base from which he ventured on many painting and drawing expeditions, including one memorable visit to Lake Eyre in flood, which became the subject of a major series of paintings and prints.In 1980 Olsen moved to Wagga Wagga to join fellow artist Noela Hjorth. Later they moved to Clarendon in the Adelaide Hills, where he lived and worked until the end of the relationship in 1987.He returned to Sydney’s artistic community in Paddington. In 1989 he moved to Wentworth Falls in the Blue Mountains with his fourth wife, Katherine. In 1999 they moved to a large property, Owlswood, near Bowral, and in 2011 to a seaside property at Avoca Beach on the Central Coast.John Olsen has been one of Australia’s most consistently honoured artists for most of his professional life. His work is represented in most Australian public collections and he has been the subject of a number of monographs. He was awarded an O.B.E. for services to the Arts in 1977 and an Order of Australia (A.O.) in 2001.In 2011 he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Newcastle.


"
Bill Onus,"
      William Townsend (Bill) Onus 1906-68.   Designer, entrepreneur, performer and activist William Townsend (Bill) Onus (also known as W T Onus) was born on 15 November 1906 at the Cummeragunja Aboriginal Reserve, New South Wales. He was the eldest of three children born to William Townsend Onus, a drover from Wollambi, New South Wales, and his wife Maude Mary (née Nelson) from Framlingham, Victoria. Bill Onus, his brother Eric and sister Maude (Sissy) grew up alongside a future generation of political activists who called Cummeragunja home: William Cooper, Doug Nicholls, John (Jack) Patten, and Margaret Tucker. In 1916 with ongoing land seizures and the removal of children, Maude Onus joined the growing exodus from Cummeragunja and moved to nearby Echuca, Victoria. Two years later the family traveled in a covered wagon to join Bill’s father, a sheep and cattle drover in the Riverina. Bill Onus lived with his family for a further four years then left at the age of sixteen to work as a shearer. On 12 May 1928 he married Bella Elizabeth Patten at St Andrew’s Presbyterian Church, West Wyalong. Bella Patten was the sister of Jack Patten who led the 1939 walk-off from Cummeragunja. Following their marriage Onus and his wife had two daughters, Christine (1928-51) and Isobel (1930-c.1976); they were divorced in 1941.    In the following decades Onus traveled widely adding to his political education. In 1929 he moved to Sydney, initially living in an unemployment camp until he obtained skilled work. At one stage he worked as a rigger at the Bankstown aerodrome. With the onset of the Depression, Onus tried his luck prospecting on the south coast at Bega, New South Wales. In 1934 he returned to Sydney where he drove delivery trucks. During this period he lived at the Salt Pan Creek camp in south-western Sydney together with other refugee families from the north and south coast and Cummeragunja including Jack Patten Snr, Jack Campbell and Pearl Gibbs (Goodall 1996, pg 160). Heather Goodall reports that at Salt Pan Creek the older men talked politics “all the time” (Goodall 1996, pg 160) and it is likely that Onus joined the younger men who went to Paddy’s market on Friday nights to hear Aboriginal speakers spruiking on land rights. In 1939 Onus joined the Aborigines Progressive Association (APA) formed two years previously by Bill Ferguson (whom he had once met at Cummeragunja) and Jack Patten. In the political struggle for equality and civil rights Ferguson “needed an uncompromising radical like Onus” (Horner 1974, pg 92); he invited Onus to become secretary of the APA. Employed full-time by the APA and living in a Newtown flat, Onus used his organizational skills and political contacts to achieve reform. He established a Moree branch of the APA. He also played a key role in the Committee for Aboriginal Citizen Rights (associated with the Australian Labor Party) in its campaign to reform the Aborigines Welfare Board of New South Wales. Working with Aboriginal families who had recently arrived in Redfern he fostered a new community spirit by organizing weekly dances at the Railway Institute Hall to raise funds for Aboriginal legal aid for returned soldiers and the All Blacks Football Team which he founded in 1938 with Wesley Simms of La Perouse (Horner 1974, pg 135).    In 1946 Onus moved to Melbourne where he rejoined his parents and worked as a shipping clerk. He married Scotswoman Mary McLintock Kelly on 10 June 1947. Mary Kelly’s parents initially disapproved of the marriage. Nevertheless they built a house for the couple next door in Deepdene, a Melbourne suburb (Neale 2000, pg 13). Bill and Mary Onus’s only child, William McLintock Onus (known as Lin Onus) was born the following year. Bill Onus and Mary Kelly met at a Communist Party rally and in 1947 Mary Kelly was crowned Miss Communist Party. Such left wing associations created problems however: in 1952 a 'derogatory’ report received by the American Consulate prevented Bill Onus from traveling to America to participate in a boomerang throwing demonstration in a sportsman’s carnival at Los Angeles (Argus, 4 April 1952).    From the late 1940s onwards, Onus, together with his brother Eric and Doug Nicholls played a leading role in the Australian Aborigines’ League (AAL) formed in 1934. Both fine orators, Bill Onus and Nicholls traveled constantly, taking advantage of every available platform – public rallies, community meetings and the media – in the struggle to gain equality and justice for Aboriginal people. In the 1940s Nicholls and Onus organized support for campaigns such as the Pilbara strike in Western Australia and opposition to the Woomera rocket testing range in South Australia. A decade later Onus joined the protest against the British government’s atomic bomb program at Maralinga (Attwood 2003, p 102, 149). In 1949, as president of the AAL, Onus spoke at the Sydney Domain with Ferguson and Reg Saunders and he organized a deputation to H.V. Johnson, Minister for the Interior. Onus supported Ferguson’s political campaign as an Independent candidate for the House of Representatives seat of Lawson and at one stage he considered standing for federal parliament himself but, wary of party politics, he decided to withdraw. From 1947 onwards the AAL was involved in the fight to retain Lake Tyers Aboriginal Reserve in Victoria. In 1963 Bill and Eric Onus organized a march in Melbourne that coincided with the presentation of another petition to parliament. Subsequently they joined forces with Stan Davey to form the Save Lake Tyers Committee (Atwood 2003, pp 244-5). Such sustained political activism resulted in the first successful land rights claim in Victoria with the return of Lake Tyers to the traditional owners in 1971.    During the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s Aboriginal culture was increasingly mobilized as a form of political protest. Onus directly contributed to these developments: drawing upon a well-established tradition of Indigenous performance he engaged in new, more public expressions of Aboriginality. Onus perceived that the way to overcome institutionalized racism was to present to the public individuals such as the artist Albert Namatjira, actor Robert Tudawali and singer Harold Blair who had achieved success in their chosen fields (Kleinert 1999). Writing in the program for the Corroboree Season 1949 staged at Wirth’s Olympia, Melbourne, (the present site of the Victorian Arts Centre) he said: “For many years we have endeavored to obtain full citizen rights for all aborigines throughout Australia but our pleas have been left unanswered.”Events such as the Corroboree Seasons staged in 1948 and 1949 celebrated a dynamic and resilient Koorie culture as a fusion of Indigenous and non-Indigenous cultural forms including tribal dance, boomerang throwing and whip cracking, a gum leaf band, a choir, vocalists and comedians.   When, in February 1951, Doug Nicholls criticized the exclusion of Aboriginal people from the jubilee celebrations planned by State of Victoria, he proposed another 'Day of Mourning’ in protest. Shamed into submission, the committee allocated £2000 plus the services of non-Indigenous professionals: director Irene Mitchell of the Little Theatre (now St Martins), scriptwriter Jean Campbell, and set designer Dres Hardingham. An Aboriginal Moomba: 'Out of the Dark’ was produced in a matter of months and staged to great acclaim over five nights with one matinee from 23-27 June 1951 at Melbourne’s prestigious Princess Theatre (Kleinert 1994, 2006; Attwood 2003). Significantly An Aboriginal Moomba starred an all-Aboriginal cast with award wages funded by the AAL (MS10368 Irene Mitchell). An Aboriginal Moomba was distinctively Aboriginal; the set design reproduced a watercolour landscape by the famous Arrernte artist Albert Namatjira while the proscenium arch featured geometric designs based on the dendroglyphs (carved trees) unique to the southeast. The program celebrated the ancient and the modern within Indigenous culture. The first half, focused on The Past, relayed the myth of Toolaba, with Onus featuring as the tribal leader Wurrawilberoo. The second half of the program staged a contemporary cabaret with tenor Harold Blair and Torres Strait Islander Dulcie Pitt appearing under her stage name Georgia Lee. In the dramatic finale Onus sent boomerangs flying around the auditorium and swallowed fire. Lin Onus remembered An Aboriginal Moomba as “the most amazing shot in the arm” because it “was so extraordinarily positive and it really gave people something to be proud of” (Kleinert 1999, pg 348). Such was the impact of An Aboriginal Moomba that in 1955, the Melbourne City Council accepted Bill Onus’s proposal of the Aboriginal word 'Moomba’ meaning 'let’s get together and have fun’ as the name for Melbourne’s new Autumn Festival (Kleinert 1999, 2006). Debate continues to circulate however around the various meanings of the word (Fraser 2008).    Onus also contributed to social cohesion and cultural renewal through his skills and knowledge in the production and display of returning boomerangs. During the 1940s and 1950s Onus gained renown for his masterly displays of boomerang throwing at tourist sites such as Koala Park, Sydney; Station Pier and St Kilda Pier, Melbourne, and the Colin MacKenzie Sanctuary, Healesville. Working from his home at 33 Terry Street in the Melbourne suburb of Deepdene, Onus began to forge a new career as an entrepreneur with the sale of Aboriginal art. Although a severe road accident in 1952 left him an invalid for a year and unable to return to his former employment, the compensation he received enabled him establish Aboriginal Enterprises, a tourist outlet for Aboriginal art and souvenirs in Belgrave, Victoria, with branches at Port Augusta South Australia (1964) and Narbethong, Victoria (c.1965). Through his creative initiative Onus established a model for cultural maintenance fostering social cohesion and working to rebuild cultural pride in the Aboriginal community. Onus provided training and employment to a great many Aboriginal people including members of his extended family: Eric, manager of the Narbethong branch and his wife Winnie; sister Maude (Sissy) and several of her sons (James Onus and Joe, Bruce, Dennis and John McGuinness); his son Lin; his daughter Isobel and her son Warren (Woz) Owens. Singer and musician Margaret Tucker, who performed in weekend concerts, remembered Aboriginal Enterprises as “a rallying place for all of us Aborigines” (Tucker 1977, pg 179). Onus also employed non-Aboriginal staff such as designer Paula Kerry (later O’Dare) (1928-2008) whose screen printed textiles appear in curtains and furniture. Kerry also painted the boomerangs made from timber sourced from the nearby State forest and produced industrially in the workshop. Aboriginal Enterprises sold a wide variety of merchandise including bark paintings from Arnhem Land and locally produced artifacts, furniture, textiles and pottery featuring Aboriginal motifs. During the 1950s and 1960s Onus toured constantly in Victoria and interstate and to New Zealand performing at various venues: schools, agricultural shows, department stores and special events such as Scout Jamborees, Home Shows and the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. Onus also supported the wider Aboriginal community: in the 1960s he helped Ella Simon establish the Gillawarra Gift Shop at Purflett, NSW (Simon 1987, pp 82-88, 103, 144-6, 154; Davis-Hurst 1996, p 85). Through his actions Onus succeeded in projecting a new and distinctive contemporary Aboriginal presence in south-eastern Australia.   Onus also saw the potential of media representations. During the 1930s and 1940s he played several minor parts in films such as Uncivilised (1936), Lovers and Luggers (1937) and The Overlanders (1946). In 1945 he performed in White Justice, based on the Pilbara strike in north-west Australia jointly produced by the Melbourne New Theatre and the AAL. During the 1950s and 1960s Onus pioneered the Indigenous use of 8mm home movies to document local tourists and visiting celebrities such as Jamaican calypso singer Harry Belafonte learning to throw a boomerang at Aboriginal Enterprises. In the 1960s Onus became a household name as narrator for the Australian Broadcasting Commission’s twelve part television children’s series Alcheringa (1961) aimed at reclaiming recognition for a Koorie cultural heritage (Few 1963, Kleinert 1994). Subsequently he co-starred with Doug Nicholls in Forgotten People, an AAL funded documentary film produced after the 1967 referendum which drew attention to the plight of Aboriginal people – many ex-Cummeragunja residents – living in the Murray-Goulburn Valley of Victoria. Such early forays into film and television may be seen to have contributed to Aboriginal advancement by giving publicity to the Aboriginal cause. Writing in The Age (2 July 1964) Onus said, “Without TV we would be a long way behind yet.”   In 1967 Onus became the first Aboriginal president of the Victorian Aborigines Advancement League and its representative on the Victorian Aboriginal Welfare Board. For over a decade Onus led the Victorian 'vote yes’ campaign in the Referendum of 1967. Sadly, one year after the Referendum, on 10 January 1968 Onus died at his home in Deepdene. Bill Onus provided a role model for engagement in the arts that is evident in following generations: Christine’s daughter Christine Onus (later Donnelly), founder and Executive Director of the Aboriginal Dance Theatre Redfern and her daughter Aiyisha, involved in the visual and performing arts; Isobel’s son Warren (Woz) Owens, an actor; Lin, who achieved recognition as an artist (Neale 2000); Lin’s children Kenneth and Biralee from his first marriage, and Tiriki from his second marriage, an artist and music student; and Bill’s nephew, writer, filmmaker and activist Bruce McGuinness.   Growing recognition for Bill Onus and his achievements is evident in recent exhibitions such as 'Making a show of it’ (2008) and 'Modern Times: the untold story of Modernism in Australia’ (2008), and in the collections of the National Museum of Australia, Australian Museum, Powerhouse Museum and South Australian Museum.        


"
Lin Onus,"
Born on 4 December 1948, Lin Onus is widely acknowledged as a pioneer of the Aboriginal art movement in 'urban’ Australia and as a man ahead of his time. He was the only child of Bill Onus, a Yorta Yorta man from the Aboriginal community of Cummeragunja in Victoria, near the town of Echuca, and a Scottish mother, Mary McLintock Kelly, whose family was from Glasgow. His political education was partly the consequence of living with parents who were politically active on a number of fronts, including a close association with the Australian Communist Party: they first met at a rally, and his mother was crowned Miss Communist Party 1947. It was from them that Lin gained his strong social conscience and the determination to fight for the rights of the underdog and the oppressed, which can be seen in many of his later works. He was also an incisive commentator on rights through his active involvement with organisations such as the Aborigines Advancement League in Melbourne and the Aboriginal Arts Board in the 1980s with a strong undercurrent of land rights activism since the 1970s. He also exhibited a passion for teaching – from conducting the first Aboriginal cartoon workshop in Melbourne in 1988 to lecturing on Aboriginal kinship systems in Japan the following year.His cultural education on his Aboriginal side was provided by visits to Cummerangunja with his father, and stories told by his uncle Aaron Briggs, who gave him his Koori name – Burrinja, meaning 'star’. They would sit on the banks of the Murray River within the view of the Barmah Forest, Onus’s spiritual home and the subject of many of his paintings and also his final resting place. Another training ground of profound cultural significance was his father Bill Onus’s 'Aboriginal Enterprises’ shop in the Dandenong’s, Victoria – a pioneering venture by an ex-mission man established 15 years before Aboriginal people gained voting rights. This shop produced tourist trade artefacts and was a model of economic independence and cultural maintenance that provided the young Onus with a grounding in many of the critical issues such as Indigenous copyright, appropriation and equality that would increasingly occupy his art and life. After being expelled at the age of 14 from Balwyn High School in Melbourne, Onus applied to be a fireman with the Victorian Country Fire Authority but this application was rejected reputedly because of his father’s high political profile.Onus discovered a set of watercolour paints left at his father’s Aboriginal Enterprises shop, and with these, created his first painting. The sale of this painting in 1974 encouraged him to continue and the following year, 1975, he mounted his first exhibition at the Aborigines Advancement League in Melbourne. This organisation, initially established by his father, his uncle Eric Onus and others, was a symbolically significant site for the young Onus, foreshadowing the powerful link between his art and the political and cultural milieu that was to become a distinguishing characteristic of his career. He had another 17 solo exhibitions, which together with group shows, totalled some 80 exhibitions in Australian and international venues. Onus was the recipient of many awards and appointments of note. These included the Introduced Media Section in the Fifth National Aboriginal Art Award, Darwin, 1988; the Kate Challis RAKA (Ruth Adeney Koori Award), Melbourne, 1993; he was made a member of the Order of Australia on the Queen’s Birthday Honours List that same year. In 1994 Onus was overall winner and the winner of the People’s Choice Award of the National Indigenous Heritage Art Award, Canberra. Appointed a member of the Aboriginal Arts Board of the Australia Council in 1986, Onus became chairman of the Board from 1989 to 1992, was co-founder of the Aboriginal Arts Management Association in 1990 (later known as NIAAA) and was a founding member and Director of Viscopy in 1995.Onus was a self-taught artist and it was this trait that afforded him, according to his primary agent, Gabrielle Pizzi, in a 1998 interview with the author, “a wonderful freedom” to develop into one of Australia’s best known and most individual landscape and photorealist artists. It also enabled him to study a diversity of artists, from cultures, times and places best suited to his purposes.It was as the Victorian representative of the Aboriginal Arts Board of the Australia Council in 1986 that Onus had the opportunity to visit Maningrida in Arnhem Land, Northern Territory, and to meet traditional elders such as Jack Wunuwun, who became his adoptive father and mentor. He was given stories and designs that expanded his visual repertoire and enabled him to develop a distinctive visual language from a combination of traditional and contemporary Aboriginal imagery and photorealist landscapes.According to academic and curator Ted Gott (Urban Dingo, p.18), it was Onus’s ability to “unsettle the natural or established order of things, to subvert conventional expectations” that made him such an extraordinary artist. Gott sees Onus at his most “wicked” in the pivotal work Fruit Bats 1991, which by popular demand have been on display at the Art Gallery of New South Wales since they were acquired. This installation is of carved fruit bats striped with rarrk, suspended on a backyard Hills Hoist clothesline. Littered below are the bat droppings on small discs of flower designs, referencing the Flying Fox Dreaming to which Onus was permitted access. From that initial 1986 Arnhem Land visit Onus managed 14 more trips in the following 16 years to Maningrida and Garmedi where he was further inducted into the laws, customs and language of his Arnhem Land affiliates.From 1988 Onus discovered that sculpture was the medium through which he could best combine his wide range of manual skills from previous occupations as a panel beater, motor mechanic and carver, as well as provide the interaction with his viewers that he desired. It also became his most effective tool for incisive political comment on contemporary issues such as Aboriginal deaths in custody, oppressive Indigenous policies, the 1950s atomic tests and injustices perpetrated against the East Timorese by Indonesia. Onus was a “cultural terrorist” of gentle irreverence who brought differences together by exploring what it means to be Australian.Onus died prematurely in Melbourne on the 24th October, 1996 not living long enough to see the mounting of a retrospective of his art, Urban Dingo, curated by Margo Neale, at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney from August to October 2000, which then toured to Queensland Art Gallery in Brisbane November 2000 to March 2001 and the Melbourne Museum in Melbourne from April to July 2001. 


"
Polixeni Papapetrou,"
Photographer, was born in Melbourne where she lives and works. Papapetrou originally trained as a lawyer, graduating with a BA/LLB, University of Melbourne in 1984. In 1997, she graduated with a Master of Arts, (Media Arts), RMIT University and in 2007 with a PhD, Monash University.
Papapetrou practiced as a lawyer between 1986-2001 but she began making photographs in 1987. From the outset of her practice, the themes of dress-ups, performance and the representation of identity have been a common thread in her work. Her first series, Elvis Immortal, made between 1987 and 2002, portrays Elvis Presley fans paying homage to Elvis on the anniversary of his death. Elvis Immortal was exhibited at the State Library of Victoria (1991), Bendigo Art Gallery, Victoria (1997), Old Treasury, Melbourne (1998), Nellie Castan Gallery, Melbourne (2006) and RMIT Gallery Melbourne (2007).
A few years later Papapetrou turned to the figure of Marilyn Monroe in her series Seaching for Marilyn (2002). Papapetrou was drawn to the figures of Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe because their image is so powerfully emblematic and instantly identifiable in contemporary culture. In Searching for Marilyn , Papapetrou visually explores a classic female icon that was as influential as Elvis Presley. Marilyn Monroe is probably the most well-known female of the 20th century but differed from Elvis in that she was the great female fantasy of an era and symbolized the way that society views specific gender roles – she was not only adored for her acting abilities, but also for her physicality and appearance. Rather than photograph fans and devotees as in the Elvis Immortal series, she decided to explore ideas about Marilyn Monroe as a Hollywood creation, existing only as a constructed identity and someone whose identity was constantly changing depending on what was expected of her. To portray this idea she photographed a female impersonator to show how he could become 'Marilyn’. Marilyn’s sexual identity was based on dress, theatre and performance rivalling that of a drag queen. The image of Marilyn was positioned in a triptych juxtaposed with images from art history to explore different facets of Marilyn’s identity such as in the work, Muse, where Papapetrou used Jean Marc Nattier’s painting of Thalia, the muse of comedy, to evoke the idea of the filmic Marilyn archetype as the muse or inspiration for post-war American values, with all their reality and sexual fantasy. Searching for Marilyn was first shown at Monash Gallery of Art (2002) and Nellie Castan Gallery (2006).
Between 1995 to 2002, Papapetrou examined various constructions of identity based on body and dress. In Curated Bodies (1996), Papapetrou explored the biological and social constructions of gender in a suite of photographs of drag queens and female body builders. Curated Bodies was shown at the Centre for Contemporary Photography, Melbourne (1996). Papapetrou continued her exploration of the body by photographing body builders in depth in her series Body/Building (1997-2002). She was interested in looking at how body builders were able to transform their body through diet and exercise. Papapetrou placed images of body builders against images of neo-classical architecture found in Melbourne such as Parliament House and Treasury to make the connection between Classical Greek notions of the ideal body and architecture. According to Papapetrou, the Hellenic ideal of beauty, which identified perfection with a virile muscular body, well suited to sports, still dominates in our culture. The works were run together to form a frieze that assumed the rhythms of an ancient Greek architectural frieze. Body/Building was first exhibited at Australian Centre for Photography, Sydney (1997) and the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne (2003).
In Authority (2001) Papapetrou looked at how identity isexpressed through the fashion brand logo. For this series, Papapetrou photographed friends wearing T-shirts with designer logos printed on them and compared them to well-known images from the art history of royalty and the aristocracy to make the point that 'fashion’ is the new royalty. Papapetrou explored the idea of brand as a metaphor for worship in contemporary society and made connections between how popular culture informs personal identity. Authority was first shown at the Australian Centre for Photography, Sydney (2001)
Since 2002, Papapetrou has turned her focus to the subject matter of childhood. Whether she is drawing upon ideas about the representation of childhood from 19th century photography, such as in Dreamchild (2003) and Wonderland (2004), exploring the power of dress ups as in Phantomwise (2002), revisiting the experience of childhood in colonial Australia as in Haunted Country ( 2006 ) or reflecting upon a lost freedom and the regulated lives of children growing up in the world today as in Games of Consequence (2008), she is reflecting upon the different facets of childhood and presenting a picture of a more knowing child.
The main protagonists in her work have been her two children Olympia (born 1997) and Solomon (born 1999). Papapetrou started making pictures about childhood because she wanted to communicate ideas about our culture that are best expressed through the symbol of the child, but more importantly, she is fascinated by the world of childhood. Her first body of work made with her daughter was Phantomwise in 2002. Olympia was four years old when they embarked upon the project. In Phantomwise , Olympia wore a series of masks that concealed her face from above the nose, but allowed her mouth and ears to be revealed. The eyes, eyebrows, and forehead are fully drawn in the mask and there was a small eyehole in place of the pupil that enabled Olympia to see. Papapetrou was interested in the performative nature of the mask and how it could be used as a device to move Olympia and the photograph from the 'real’ to the 'imaginary’ – both body and photograph were transformed by the mask. Phantomwise was first exhibited as Olympia Masked Ballarat Fine Art Gallery (2002) and curated in Photographica Australis , Sala De Exposiciones Del Canal De Isabel II, Madrid, Spain (2002), National Gallery of Thailand, Bangkok (2003) and Singapore Art Museum, Singapore (2003). It was also exhibited at Stills Gallery, Sydney (2003) and Monash University Gallery of Art, Melbourne, (2004).
Following Phantomwise , Papapetrou made Dreamchild (2003), a series based on the 19th century photographs of Charles Dodgson, more commonly known as Lewis Carroll, the genial author of Alice in Wonderland . She was drawn to re-staging Dodgson’s photographs because his portrayal of dress up games – the games that children play in everyday life and have often performed for the camera – typified the boundary-crossing experience that occurs in photography. She photographed her daughter Olympia in a variety of dress – Oriental, Middle Eastern, Victorian and other exotic costumes. The works raise questions about how Olympia presents herself as a female child and how she and the mother/artist explore the boundaries of her identity, through her dress-up performances before the camera. Dreamchild was exhibited at Kalli Rolfe Contemporary Art, Melbourne (2003), Bendigo Art Gallery, Victoria (2003) and photographic, New York (2003), Stills Gallery, Sydney (2004), Monash University Museum of Art, Melbourne (2004), Nexus Gallery, Adelaide (2004), Johnson Gallery, Perth (2005), Australian Centre for Photography, Sydney (2005) and 'Le Mois de la Photo’, 9th Montreal Photography Biennale, Montréal (2005).
Following Dreamchild , Papapetrou looked at how Lewis Carroll portrayed the girl figure in the character of Alice from Alice in Wonderland . In her series Wonderland (2004), Papapetrou explores the psychological and physical presence in the fictive role that her daughter steps into. While Olympia remains distinctively child-like – acting the part of a child – her girl’s presence latches onto a famous hallowed story, assuming a larger-than-life stature, and through the performance, Olympia’s self is challenged as much as it is celebrated. In staging the photographs for Wonderland , Papapetrou created a fantasy world to mirror Lewis Carroll’s dream where imagination and reality are almost mystically equated. She borrowed from the tradition of theatre and used scenic backdrops (as she had in some of the images in Dreamchild ) . The backdrops set the scene and dramatized the movement from reality to imagination as in theatre. The scenic backdrops were based on the illustrations that appeared in the original publication of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland made by Sir John Tenniel. The large canvases measuring 3m x 3m were painted by Olympia’s father, Robert Nelson. Wonderland was at shown at Stills Gallery, Sydney (2004), Kalli Rolfe Contemporary Art, Melbourne (2004), 'Le Mois de la Photo’, 9th Montreal Photography Biennale, Montréal (2005), Bathurst Regional Art Gallery, New South Wales (2005), Monash University Gallery (2006) , Horsham Regional Art Gallery, Victoria (2006), Te Tuhi Gallery, Manukau City, New Zealand (2007), Roger Williams Contemporary, Auckland (2007) and Warnambool Art Gallery (2008).
In 2006, Papapetrou moved her work from the realm of fantasy into the natural world. This seemed an appropriate move as the children were growing older and their experience of the world was shifting from the imaginative interior world of dress-ups and make-believe into a more pragmatic experience with the world beyond the home. Her series Haunted Country, (2006) was inspired by nineteenth century real and fictional accounts of children who went missing in the Australian bush. To make these photographs, Papapetrou went to the sites of the most notorious disappearances including the Wimmera, Daylesford and Hanging Rock, where she staged scenes proposing what the physical and psychological circumstances may have been like for these lost and wandering children. Haunted Country captures feelings about the Australian landscape and our history to it, but also about children and their eternal vulnerability in both the natural and social orders. The landscape seems to act metaphorically, almost a resonant backdrop for a social 'distancing’ that can occur with children lost in other senses. Haunted Country was exhibited at Foley Gallery, New York (2006), Johnston Gallery, Perth (2006), Williams Contemporary, Auckland (2007), Nellie Castan Gallery, Melbourne (2007), National Arts Center, Tokyo (2008) and included in many curated exhibitions in Australia and internationally including the Museum of Photographic Arts, San Diego (2007) and Aperture Foundation, New York (2007), De Cordova Museum and Sculpture Park, Lincoln, Massachusetts (2008) and the McClleland Gallery and Sculpture Park, Victoria (2008).
Making Haunted Country caused Papapetrou to think about the type of childhood she experienced compared to that of her children. Sensing that that the process of growing up in the modern world had changed and that her children – the subjects of much of her work – were growing up, the exploration of personal individuality seemed a natural next step. Games of Consequence (2008) is based on Papapetrou’s childhood memories of play, incidents that happened to her and feelings that she experienced growing up. By exploring her memories of play that occurred in places beyond the home, she wanted to reflect on the freedom that children of her generation enjoyed in these arcane spaces. To tell this story, Papapetrou ventured back into the landscape, but stepped outside the idea that the Australian bush equates with mortality (as in Haunted Country ) to consider the landscape as a medium in which she could explore ideas about the changed social landscape of childhood. The landscape is not portrayed as menacing as in Haunted Country, but some of the works hint at an undercurrent of danger in the air, which may be psychological rather than physical. In this series, Papapetrou uses the depth and complexity of the natural world as a backdrop in which she explores some of the idyllic and darker aspects of growing up. The land is represented as a space without constraints and a place where children can attempt to define their individuality through their surroundings. The series was first shown at the National Arts Center, Tokyo (2008), then Johnson Gallery, Perth (2008), Foley Gallery, New York (2008) and Nellie Castan Gallery Melbourne (2008).


"
Mike Parr,"
Mike Parr is widely regarded as one of the most successful Australian artists of his generation. His work is imbued with a strongly cathartic presence, a direct result of his personally demanding working processes. Mike Parr has realised over 1000 works within the context of his self-imposed 'Self-Portrait’ series, in a range of media that includes performance, installation, sculpture, drawing, drypoint etching and photography.
Parr is a captivating public speaker. His performance works have often tested the limits of the artist’s own body and often impact deeply on his audiences. In his performance entitled Close the Concentration Camps , 2002, Parr had his lips sewn together in solidarity with refugees in Australia’s detention centres. His representation in the 2005 Sherman Galleries exhibition 'Text Me: An Exploration of Body Language’ similarly referenced the inhumane treatment of Australia’s detainees.
Mike Parr has exhibited prodigiously both in Australia and internationally, and been represented in important exhibitions in Brazil, Cuba, France, Germany, Hungary, Japan, Korea, Taiwan and the United States. He was included in the 12th Biennale of Sydney (2000) and the Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art: Contemporary Photo-media (2004). In 2005, the Newcastle Region Art Gallery held the survey exhibition, 'CUT YOUR THROAT AN INCH AT A TIME: A Survey of the Works of Mike Parr 1970-2005’, including 30 major works, a site-specific live performance and new sculptural installation.
In 2005-06, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney, exhibited a major survey of Parr’s prints, while also representing his work in its exhibition of international contemporary self-portraits; confirming his position as one of Australia’s most important and challenging artists. A catalogue raisonné of Mike Parr’s work on DVD-ROM was in production in 2006.

John Passmore,
Myra Nungarrayi Patrick,"
Born at Willowra c.1946. Her country is Wirliyajarrayi (Two Feet), which is the Warlpiri name for Willowra. She paints Mala, Juwurrpa, Ngatijirri (Bush Budgerigar), Witi/kurlarda (Spear/Pole) – from Kurlangalimpa (Duck Pond), Jurdiya (Snake), Ngalyipi (Snake Vine), Jurlpa (Butcher Bird), Watiya and Karrkarrdu (Cockatoo) Dreamings, some of these in conjunction with her husband, Freddy Patrick Jangala – they often paint sitting down together, though mostly they do separate paintings. They live just outside of Lajamanu settlement. Myra started painting in 1986. Her work is immediately identifiable by her absolutely miniscule dots, which were part of Myra’s conscious development of her own individualistic style. Minute dots are now a familiar technique, but few have used them with such subtle refinement. She collects tiny twigs and sharpens them to do the dots. She estimates that she takes about five weeks to complete a canvas. By the early ’90s Myra had developed RSI from painting, and was told to quit, but refused to. Her work is like pointillism, but with assymmetrical qualities that distinguish it from pop art. She has worked these effects on pottery for an exhibition at the National Gallery of Victoria in 1990. A Botany glass factory has also signed a contract with Myra Patrick and Marjorie Watson to blow their designs into glass.

Patricia Payne,"
Printmaker, pencil and charcoal artist and teacher, completed a BA (Archaeology and Education) at Sydney University in 1973-76, then BA in Printmaking (1978-81) and a Postgraduate Diploma in Printmaking (1982-83) at Sydney College of the Arts. Her many solo exhibitions began in 1983 at the Upstairs Gallery, SCA; in 2001 she had another large solo show there. In 1985 she had a solo exhibition of her prints and drawings at Union Street Gallery, Sydney. Between 1982 and 1987 she exhibited in numerous group and prize shows (mainly prints) in Victoria, Fremantle, Barcelona and Sydney (including group shows at Hogarth Gallery in 1986 and 1987). In 1987, with Corinne Fletcher and Shelagh Morgan, Payne contributed 43 drawings to a travelling exhibition about female space as shelter mounted by Lismore Art Gallery, Genii loci: a spirit of place ; the catalogue included essays by Julie Ewington and Anna Rubbo.
Payne has also been exhibiting regularly with aGOG and its successor the Helen Maxwell Gallery; Joan Kerr opened her solo exhibition at the latter in 2001. Her series Murmur 1-8 shown at aGOG in October-November 1994 consisted of woodcuts and a 20-page book with 9 wood engravings and a photo-etched text. She also does lithographs in collaboration with the master printer Fred Genis, e.g. Weaving Dreams 1995, lithograph (burgundy colour), AGNSW, and large semi-abstract charcoal, pencil and pastel drawings, often evoking a woman’s body shape and including personal, semi-surreal images about herself, e.g. Cities of the Interior shows her with symbols of medical technology. Her series Thinking about Leaving (aGOG, 1992) was inspired by a Stevie Smith poem.
Payne taught at SCA in the early 1990s and has been Head of the Print Workshop at Canberra School of Art, ANU since 1995.


"
John Perceval,"
John Perceval was born on 1 February 1923 with the name Linwood Robert Steven South Bruce Rock in Western Australia. His father, Robert South, was a wheat farmer, a man well known for his hard work and violent temper. His parents’ marriage was short-lived. His mother, born Dorothy Dolton, left when the boy was only 18 months old, with his older sister unhappily stayed with their father until 1934 when their mother married William de Burgh Perceval in Melbourne. John Perceval took his stepfather’s name, and began to attend Trinity Grammar. At the age of 15 he suffered from polio, and spent a year in hospital. As a part of his recovery he began to paint.He came to know the artists associated with Melbourne’s newly established Contemporary Art Society, and through them joined the circle of artists and writers around John and Sunday Reed at Heide Park. Despite his withered leg John Perceval enlisted in the Army as his skills as a draughtsman could be used in the Cartographic Company. Here he met Arthur Boyd, and then the entire extended Boyd family at Murrumbeena. He married Arthur’s youngest sister, Mary Boyd, in 1944. With Arthur Boyd and Neil Douglas he worked at the Murrumbeena pottery, making decorated pots and bowls. His paintings of this period show a strong influence of Arthur Boyd’s work, with a joyeus brush stroke and an almost naive quality.The Perceval family lived at Williamstown, at the old naval port on the mouth of the Yarra and the working harbour became a part of his subject matter. His subject matter was sometimes metaphorical, but always based in elements of his life. The city of Melbourne became the background for a nativity scene, painted in a style that quoted Breughel. His children: Matthew, Tessa, Celia and Alice all appear as reoccurring elements in his art. No more is this more evident than in his series of ceramic angels, made between 1957 and 1962. While they certainly quoted Renaissance sculptural figures and  Piero della Francesca’s paintings, the joie de vivre of these (sometimes) quite naughty figures owes more to his observations of his children – although one is modelled on the satirist Barry Humphries.In 1959, Perceval was persuaded by Bernard Smith to join with his brothers-in-law Arthur and David Boyd, John Brack, Robert Dickerson, Charles Blackman and Clifton Pugh to form the Antipodeans a celebration of the human figure, in opposition to the rise of abstract art. His own paintings however concentrated on landscapes, and increasingly he found more nourishment from Vincent Van Gogh than any other artist.Perceval’s bad memories, alcoholism and long undiagnosed psychiatric illness meant that life was less than easy for his family and his marriage ended unhappily. In 1965 he was hospitalised for alcoholism, and in 1977 he entered the Larundal psychiatric hospital, where he stayed until 1986.Perceval continued to paint for the rest of his life, but although he had some commercial success, these later works appear crude when placed next to his paintings of the 1940s and ’50s.

Kathleen Petyarre,
Kathleen Petyarre,"
An Anmatyerre speaker, born c.1930, Kathleen Petyarre’s traditional country is Atnangkere, an important soakage on the western boundary of Utopia station which, on account of the abundance of food it provided, was keenly sought by neighbouring Eastern Arrente groups. Her father had three wives, and several daughters, who in recent times have managed to hold onto the area as a group, establishing camp at Atneltyeye Boundary Bore. Kathleen’s Dreamings include Women Hunting Emu with Dingo, and Mountain Devil Lizard, and like most of the Utopia artists, she took up painting in 1988-9 as part of CAAMA’s Summer Project after previously working in batik. A talented batik artist, Kathleen is enjoying exploring the technical possibilities of acrylic on canvas. A 6 × 3 m silk batik in the collection of Museums & Art Galleries of NT shows reciprocally the influence of working with paint on both the scale and the technique of her batiks.

Long Jack Tjakamarra Phillipus,"
Born c. 1932 Long Jack grew up in the bush west of Mt Farewell and came into Haasts Bluff settlement with his whole family as a teenager. Worked at Haasts Bluff as a timber contractor and stockman. He married Georgette Napaltjarri*. They had two sons and three daughters. Long Jack has been part of the Papunya painting movement since the beginning of the 70s when he was a Councillor at Papunya. It was Long Jack, together with Billy Stockman who was also a school yardman at the time, who offered their help with painting the smaller murals around the Papunya school which preceded the renowned large Honey Ant mural. Long Jack has painted ever since those times, taking out the Northern Territory Golden Jubilee Art Award in 1983 and the Alice Springs Art Award in 1984. In 1984 he was ordained as a Lutheran pastor and remains a leading figure in the Christian community and the men’s ceremonial sphere. Long Jack’s paintings depict Hare Wallaby, Kingfisher, Dingo and other Dreamings in the Mt Singleton area.

"
William Robinson,"
Painter who became one of the most loved figures in Queensland art, married Shirley Reas in 1958 and completed his diploma at Central Technical College, Brisbane in 1962, by which time they had already begun their family {of at least two daughters?}. In 1970 they moved from suburban Coorparoo to a farm of eight acres at Birkdale in the Redlands district on the outskirts of Brisbane, where they enlarged the house and initially began growing nut trees – which was a disaster since Bill was teaching art in the city at the same time. In 1971 he travelled to Sydney to see the Pierre Bonnard exhibition – an enduring passion obvious in many works both before and after the visit, notably Interior with Black Dog 1970, Sophie in her Bedroom (both the study, p.c., and the final painting, QAG) 1974 and Interior with a double bed 1974 (pastel and gouache, QAG). By 1975, when he returned from a six-month teaching stint at Toowoomba and the family settled back on the farm, they 'began to collect animals with a vengeance; more and more livestock – dogs, chooks, cows and goats. Shirley was even running a little sort of dairy’ (Hart in Seear, 32).
Goats, cows and chooks 1980 was the 'Judge’s Selection’ in the 1981 Gold Coast Art Prize and acquired for the City Collection, and he had an exhibition of cow paintings at Ray Hughes Gallery that year: 'I felt a sense of amazement that I’d gone out on a limb and created something I couldn’t relate to anybody else’s work before, only to old Victorian photos in oval frames’. He exhibited Myself with Josephine the cow in the 1983 'Perspecta’ at the AGNSW, while the first of several self-portraits sent to the Archibald Prize at the AGNSW was William and Josephine 1983. The later ones were equally bucolic (and comical), including Self portrait with goose feathers 1989.
Even so, Robinson has always been primarily a painter (he is said to have claimed in the 1990s that he had painted every single day since art school) and an art teacher, rather than a farmer. In 1986, when the BA in Visual Arts was introduced at Brisbane College of Advanced Education, Robinson was appointed Head of the Painting Department. Yet when he surprisingly won the Archibald with a mildly satiric 'grand manner’ equestrian self-portrait (Ocker version) in 1987, the newspaper headlines screamed: 'Reluctant farmer wins Archibald’, 'Queensland goat farmer wins prestigious art prize’ and 'Prize for painting taken by goat man’ – a reading doubtless encouraged by Robinson’s maverick Queensland dealer, Ray Hughes. He had Landscape with fire on Mt Tambourine 1987 hung in the Wynne Prize exhibition the same year, while his farmyard scene, In the house yard 1985, was purchased for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York – but these professional triumphs were ignored by the press.
Robinson certainly painted many farmyard images, both before and after 1984 he and Shirley moved to a smaller farm at Beechmont, a mountainous eucalypt forest and subtropical rainforest area near Canungra in the Darlington Range, e.g. Farm II 1982 (viewed from above) and Farmyard Construction 1983-84 (which has no single focal point). Four of his paintings were included in the 6th Biennale of Sydney in 1986. By then he was beginning to paint large apocalyptic landscapes, e.g. Dawn 1986 (one of the first of the genre) and the large multi-panelled 'Creation landscape’ series, which includes Creation Night, Beechmont 1988 (Laverty Collection, Sydney), Creation landscape – darkness and light 1988 (five panels, AGWA) and Creation landscape – earth and sea 1995. Giant vertiginous paintings of the natural environment typify his work of the 1990s, e.g. The Rainforest 1990 (Gold Coast City Art Gallery, purchased 1991), for which he did numerous studies, lithographs and drawings (mostly private collections).
Bill and Shirley had a weekender at Kingscliff, a small seaside town in northern NSW not far from Beechmont, where they moved in 1994. They also bought a smaller, more self-sustaining property at nearby Springbrook. Seascapes then become more common, e.g. The sand ziggurat, Kingscliff 1995 (Laverty Collection, Sydney) and Late afternoon, the sea and Mt Warning 1996 (Laverty Collection, Sydney). He won the Archibald for the second time in 1995 with Self portrait with stunned mullet 1994, p.c. (partly based, said the artist, on William Hogarth’s The Shrimp Girl ) and the Wynne Prize in 1996 with Creation Landscape – Earth and Sea 1995. Two Archibald Prizes, as Michael Brand notes (Seear 42), were quite an achievement for an artist who claims to have only ever painted seven portraits – all with himself as the primary subject (and all hung in the Archibald between 1983 and 1995 – in 1996 he announced he would not enter again).
Robinson’s 8.2 metre wide Creation landscape – the ancient trees 1997, included in his solo show at Ray Hughes’s Sydney gallery in 1998, was declared an Australian masterpiece by Giles Auty, who urged the NGA to buy it (it was purchased by a Sydney private collector). John McDonald, however, preferred Dark tide, Bogangar 1994, which had been purchased by the QAG in 1995, describing it as 'a master piece of black, cosmic uncertainty, without parallel in Australian art’. In 1999, when McDonald was (briefly) Head of Australian Art at the NGA, the gallery acquired Springbrook with lifting fog 1998/9, reputedly for something in excess of $250,000.

Yhonnie Scarce,"
Yhonnie Scarce, a descendant of the Kokatha and Nukunu people, was born in Woomera, South Australia, in 1973. After leaving school, Scarce worked as a clerical support officer at the Research Branch of the University of Adelaide, then as a trainee in the visual arts department at Tandanya National Cultural Institute for a year before taking up a three year position as a receptionist for Wilto Yerlo – the Centre for Australian Indigenous Research and Studies at the University of Adelaide – but she found office work unsatisfying. During this time she considered enrolling at university as she had maintained an interest in being creative since school. She investigated what courses were available at the University of South Australia, discovering that glassblowing was offered as a major subject. Excited by the idea of learning how to work with this medium she enrolled in a Bachelor of Visual Arts in 2001, majoring in Glass (painting was her minor subject). Scarce completed her undergraduate studies in 2003 as the first Aboriginal student to graduate from that institution with a major in Glass. She then immediately took up an Honours degree in Visual Arts at the same university, completing this in 2004. In 2005 Scarce participated in a masterclass at North Lands Creative Glass Centre in Lybster, Scotland, and in 2007 she was a recipient of the 'Women in Research Fellowship’ from Monash University, where in 2008 she enrolled in a Masters of Fine Arts.Scarce began exhibiting in 2004 with her first solo exhibition, a self-titled show at the BANK Gallery, University of South Australia, and also in her graduate exhibition that same year. She continued to exhibit her glass works throughout Adelaide in various galleries including Nexus Multicultural Artspace, Tandanya (with her second solo show, 'Forget me 'NOT’', in 2006), Adelaide Festival Centre, Samstag Art Museum and the Drill Hall. She has also exhibited her work at Harrison Galleries in Sydney, and at Manningham Gallery and Linden Centre for Contemporary Art in Melbourne. The Linden Centre’s exhibition of 2008, 'The Haunted and the Bad’, was curated by Julie Gough and also featured Joel Birnie, Nici Cumpston, Tony Albert and Andrea Fisher. Her hand-blown glass objects often reference the on-going effects of colonisation on Aboriginal people and comment on the social and political mores of historical and contemporary Australia in regards to this colonisation.  Shackled is a delicate work of blown-glass Australian Indigenous fruits and nuts, strung together by a necklace-sized chain. This work talks of the restrictions placed upon Aboriginal people once their traditional way of life was removed from them through past government policies. Carrie Miller, in her article for the January-March 2009 edition of Australian Art Collector quotes writer and curator Timothy Morell who said of Scarce that she has “pulled the medium of glass right out of its crafty comfort zone and exploited its potential, perhaps for the first time in Australia, to be emotionally and politically expressive” (pg. 120).Though only working professionally as an artist since 2004, Scarce was short-listed for the 2006 Telstra National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards at the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory and the 2007 Xstrata Coal Emerging Indigenous Art Award at Queensland Art Gallery. In 2008 she was the South Australian state recipient of the inaugural Qantas Foundation Encouragement of Australian Contemporary Art Award. The other state award recipients were Karena Keys (ACT), Alex Davies (NSW), Neridah Stockley (NT), Vernon Ah Kee (QLD), Brigita Ozolins (TAS), Katherine Huang (VIC), and Tom Muller (WA).In July of 2009 Scarce was able to showcase her work to an international audience when she participated in a group show 'Glassheart’ at Fort Vuren, Loevestein, in the Netherlands. This project came about when fellow glass artist Gerry King recommended her to the organisers of the exhibition.Though making a name as a glass artist, Scarce states that “since graduating from UniSA I have become more of an interdisciplinary artist, working with installation, ephemeral and time-based work” (pers comm, 2009). Her solo show at Tandanya included paintings as well as glass work. Scarce’s work is held in the permanent collections of the Art Gallery of South Australia, the Flinders University Art Museum, the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory and the University of South Australia Art Collection. In 2009 Scarce was living, studying and working in Melbourne, Victoria.

Martin Sharp,"
painter, cartoonist and art director, was born in Bellevue Hill [Rose Bay, acc. NGA], Sydney, on 21 January 1942. He attended Cranbrook 1952-59. While studying art at East Sydney Technical College in 1960 he submitted cartoons to the Bulletin . In 1961 he enrolled in Architecture at university (SU and/or UNSW). He was in trouble for obscenity for the cartoon The Gas Lash in the UNSWstudent publication Tharunka’s 1964 Orientation Week issue. Fifty years … says that he contributed both to Tharunka and Sydney University’s Honi Soit . In his third year of Architecture he returned to ESTC to study art, completing three of the five years of the course. In 1962 he won the Mirror Art Award. In 1963-64 he attended the Mary White Art School at the Rocks while simultaneously (1963-65 [1962-64 [ sic ] acc. McCulloch]) working as art director of Oz and being its major contributor of drawings and cartoons. The prosecution of Oz in 1964 for breach of the Obscene and Indecent Publications Act concentrated on a Sharp cartoon, The Word Spread Round the Arms (about an Ocker surfie), published in issue 6 (February; almost the same time as the similarly controversial The Gas Lash in Tharunka ), which consisted (almost) only of words (ill. Lindesay WWW , 159). Within weeks of Tharunka’s editors being convicted over The Gas Lash , Neville and Walsh were sentenced to six months gaol with hard labour and Sharp to four months, though all three were later released on bail pending an appeal, which was upheld. According to Coleman (p.12):
“The case caused such a sensation that it figured in the 1965 State election when the Opposition Leader Bob Askin, following Oz , made it his policy to abolish censorship. He won the election and that was the end of trial-by-magistrates in obscenity cases in New South Wales. It all added to the glory of Oz , Martin Sharp and cartoonists.”
A subsequent $300,000 libel suit, the departure of Sharp and Neville for England via Asia in 1966 to establish London Oz , the cancellation of advertising and the continued refusal of Gordon & Gotch to distribute Oz finally resulted in its demise (Lindesay, WWW , 156-160).
In December 1965 Sharp held a solo exhibition, Art for Mart’s Sake , at Clune Galleries, Potts Point. Martin Sharp Cartoons was published in 1966. Some of his cartoons also appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald , e.g. one about Prince Charles coming to school in Australia in 1965: “I sincerely hope he’s funnier than his father” . Others are [Aborigine in garbage tin with man bending over it] “You wouldn’t give us any trouble like those boongs in Los Angeles, would you Jacky” n.d. (ill. Coleman & Tanner, 74, 184). His cartoon Loading Up , published in the Australian 1965, about the Menzies government arms’ spending increase, is ill. King, 174.
Sharp lived and worked in London in 1967-69. He came back to Australia in 1970 then returned to collect his portable artworks for The Incredible Shrinking Exhibition group show, which opened at the Yellow House on 1 April 1971. He remained in London 1971-72 painting murals and publishing his Art Book etc..
Hamilton Art Gallery owns Sharp’s etching of Luna Park, Just For Fun? (clown on stage) 1981, ill. Hansen, cat.260 (the Hogarth Gallery’s copy was used in the 1999 S.H. Ervin Gallery show). Posters designed for the Nimrod Theatre are at ML POSTERS 810/1-7. On 4 March 2001 Dahlia Stanley was auctioning his silkscreen prints, Tiny Tim Eternal Troubadour Opera House 1982 , Kaspar (Nimrod November 7), The Venetian Twins and Art Sale for Land Rights n.d.


"
Rod Shaw,"
painter, graphic artist, cartoonist and printer, was born on 17 September 1915 at Drummoyne, Sydney. After helping milk cows on his parents’ farm at the beginning of the Depression, he served an apprenticeship as a commercial artist during the Depression then studied at East Sydney Technical College [ESTC] in the late 1930s. He helped form the Windsor Group, which painted landscapes around Windsor (see catalogue) and married actress Frances Cottingham. After about four years in the RAAF (at the Commonwealth Aircraft Factory, acc. Fox), he exhibited in the 'Australia at War’ exhibition (National Gallery of Victoria, 1945), winning a first prize for one of his paintings of Civil Construction Workers.
A member of the Communist Party of Australia, Rod Shaw was one of the founders of the Studio of Realist Art [SORA] in 1945, a body set up partly in dissatisfaction with the Contemporary Art Society (which had sided against Dobell in the 1944 Archibald Prize case). He was most active in its public programs; he showed work at the annual exhibitions, wrote and published its regular bulletins, organised art classes and taught drawing to interested Waterside Workers. After the war, with Dick Edwards, he founded the publishing company of Edwards & Shaw, which produced some of the finest art and poetry books seen in Australia; one of the last was James Mollison’s Fred Williams Etchings . It also published, for the Council of Civil Liberties, the banned report of the English trial of Penguin Books for publishing Lady Chatterley’s Lover . He was also on the editorial board of Helen Palmer’s democratic-socialist journal Outlook , for which he drew cartoons and other humorous illustrations (Fox).
Despite having little time for painting, Shaw painted Cable Layers for the 1946 NSW Travelling Art Scholarship. He did not win, but after the oil was shown at SORA that year it was purchased by the Art Gallery of New South Wales. In 1947 (with Nan Hortin , John Oldham and Kevin Lynch ) he participated in the Australian section of the British Empire Exhibition at the Royal Easter Show, painting portraits of Henry Lawson, John Macarthur and Peter Lalor. His Pyrmont Washing (originally titled Washing Out, White Bay Cutting ) of 1948 was exhibited in that year’s SORA show (ill. Merewether). In the early 1950s he and others (including Hortin) began painting a large mural in the Waterside Workers Federation offices depicting the story of the Labor Movement from the 1890s strikes onwards.
By the mid-1970s Shaw’s own paintings had turned more towards figurative abstraction, but he produced little because he was increasingly involved in publishing and teaching. He contributed articles and illustrations to Overland , eg 'Dear Stephen’ no. 56 (Spring 1973), 23. Later he taught at Sydney University’s Tin Sheds and at ESTC. He died in December 1992 (see obit. Sydney Morning Herald , 8 December).
The Roderick Shaw collection of commercial illustrations, art posters and cartoons 1940-90 (Mitchell Library PXD 836) includes his business card; three pen drawings of Bathurst Island people, one dated 1942; drawings for magazines articles, stories and festivals; prints; four Aboriginal designs by Aboriginal artists in an A4 envelope (presumably 1942); four sketchbooks and loose leaves from sketchbooks; 13 political cartoons by 'Schweik’ (a pseudonym) and four other b/w drawings.


"
Garry Shead,"
Garry James Shead, painter, print maker, cartoonist, photographer and film maker, was born in 1942 in Sydney’s northern suburbs. Shead grew up in the suburb of Gordon, attended the local primary school and then moved on to Shore (Church of England Grammar School, North Sydney) for secondary school in the 1950s. While at Shore, Shead won the art prize each year and was admitted to the National Art School (NAS) in the Sydney suburb of Darlinghurst in 1961.
While at the NAS Shead began shooting his first experimental film, Ding a Ding Day, starring Jon Crothers, Richard Neville and Martin Sharp . In 1961, Shead’s portrait of his sister Lynne was hung in the Archibald exhibition, making him one of the youngest exhibitors for the prize. Also in 1961 Shead first appeared as a cartoonist in The Bulletin , Honi Soit and the Sydney Morning Herald . He became a regular contributor to Oz magazine after its founding in 1963.
At the end of 1962 Shead left the NAS without completing his studies and, after a period of unemployment, commenced work as a scenic artist with ABC Television in 1963.
In 1966 Shead held his first solo exhibition at the Watters Gallery in Sydney. Entitled 'Wahroonga Lady and her naked lunch’, it featured erotic painted collages of North Shore matrons naked on their front lawns. The exhibition caused controversy and was visited by the police although no paintings were seized.
In the late 1960s Shead travelled to the Sepik Highlands of New Guinea on a film expedition. It was while he was in New Guinea that Shead discovered the letters of DH Lawrence, written while Lawrence was in Australia in 1922, which so heavily influenced Shead’s later work.
In the early 1970s Shead became close friends with Brett and Wendy Whiteley. Brett Whiteley shared Shead’s interest in DH Lawrence and in 1973 they travelled to Thirroul, south of Sydney, where Lawrence and his wife had lived in 1922. While there the two collaborated on a diptych Portrait of DH Lawrence which they sold in 1973. Shead’s share of the proceeds paid his airfare to Paris where he lived for six months with his wife and young daughter Gria.
During the 1970s Shead continued to make experimental films, although painting took up more of his time. In 1974 he collaborated with Martin Sharp and Peter Kingston to paint monumental murals at Luna Park, an amusement park on Sydney’s north shore.
Shead again travelled to Europe in the early 1980s, living as artist in residence in Vence, France (the place where DH Lawrence had died) in 1981. Here he met his third wife, Judit Englert, and lived with her for a year in Budapest.
The couple moved back to Australia in 1983 and finally settled in Bundeena, in the Royal National Park south of Sydney, in 1987. That year Shead embarked on the first of the 'Outback’ series of paintings, the first in which his lyrical style came to the fore. Those paintings, along with the 'Bundeena’ series in 1990, paved the way for Shead’s distinctive style to emerge in the breakthrough 'DH Lawrence’ series.
Living in the Australian bush with his European wife inspired Shead to include not only DH Lawrence in his work, but also Lawrence’s wife Frieda (the German born Baroness von Richthofen) modeled on Shead’s wife Judit. Placing a European woman against the Australian bush began with the 'DH Lawrence’ series of paintings and became a recurring theme in Shead’s work.
The 'DH Lawrence’ series was exhibited seven times during 1992-93, including a selection at the Art Gallery of NSW. With its brooding native animals and ethereal figures, the series was hugely successful for Shead and represents a watershed in his career. Shead used Lawrence’s novel Kangaroo as a springboard for the scenes in some of the works, including the figures of the kangaroo, cockatoo and currawong as the spirit of the Australian landscape brooding over the alien European visitors.
In 1993 Shead won the prestigious Archibald Prize for his portrait of publisher Tom Thompson, further entrenching his commercial success.
In 1994 Shead commenced 'The Royal Suite’ series, which was inspired by his memories of the first Royal visit to Australia in 1954. Tied up in Shead’s pre-pubescent eroticism, the series again focuses on the progress of a European woman through the Australian landscape, again employing the native animals as spiritual guides and guardians. Deliberately subversive, the paintings make subtle comments on the treatment of Aboriginal people as well as establishing Shead’s visual vocabulary of wattle sprigs and embracing couples.
In 1999 Shead commenced the 'Artist and the Muse’ series, again focusing on the female nude, this time in her role as inspiration for the works of old masters such as Velázquez, Rembrandt and Goya. Early in 2000 Shead began painting a series of religious paintings, placing Christ within the Bundeena landscape and using the sulphur crested cockatoo to symbolize the Holy Spirit.
In 2002, following the outbreak of the second Iraq war, Shead commenced work on the series 'The Apotheosis of Ern Malley’. Ern Malley was a fictitious poet, invented by James McAuley and Harold Stewart, whose poetry caused a media frenzy when it was published in 1944 and the merits of which have been hotly debated ever since. Similarly to the 'DH Lawrence’ series, Shead used the text of Ern Malley’s poetry, along with the description of his fictitious life, as inspiration for a series of paintings exploring Australian iconography. The Ern Malley paintings cast the fictitious poet as an Australian martyr who dies tragically young, is resurrected and ultimately deified. Rich in Shead’s uniquely Australian iconography, the paintings comment on Shead’s own mortality as well as the marginal place artists hold in Australian society. As part of the 'Ern Malley’ series, Shead collaborated with potter Lino Alvarez Carrasco to produce large painted urns displaying scenes from Ern Malley’s life and poetry. Colloquy with John Keats , a drawing from the 'Ern Malley’ series, was awarded the Dobell Prize for drawing in 2004.
In 2007, following the death of his wife from pancreatic cancer, Shead exhibited a series of paintings to accompany Judit Shead’s sculptures. Based loosely on the 'DH Lawrence’ series, the paintings show Judit, his wife and muse, slipping away from the earth-bound artist. After Judit’s death Shead continued to live and work in Bundeena, south of Sydney.

Paddy Japaljarri Sims,"
Born c.1917 at Mt Nicker, NT, south-west of Yuendumu at the site of Kunajarrayi, which is associated with the Initiated Ngarrka (Men) and Warna (Snake) Dreamings. He is Warlpiri and lives at Yuendumu, where he is one of the leading artists in the community. He was one of the main artists and motivators of the Yuendumu Doors project, and collaborated with Larry Jungarrayi Spencer , Jimija Jungarrayi and Paddy Jupurrurla Nelson on the painting of Munga Star Dreaming which was purchased by the National Gallery of Australia from the first Yuendumu exhibition in Sydney in 1985. The artist paints Yiwarra (Milky Way), Ngarlkirdi/Warna (Witchetty Grub/Snake), Pirntirna (Woma Python), Liwirringki (Burrowing Skink), Wanakiji (Bush Plum) and Walpa (Wind) Dreamings. His work has been in numerous group exhibitions of Warlukurlangu Artists throughout Australia since the Yuendumu painters’ first show at the Araluen Arts Centre in Alice Springs in October 1985. His paintings have also been shown in major overseas exhibitions including the Dreamings exhibition which toured North America in 1988-9 and l'été Australien at Musée Fabre, Montepellier, France, 1990. In 1988 Paddy Sims was selected by the Power Gallery, Sydney University, to travel to Paris with five other Warlpiri men from Yuendumu to create a ground painting installation at the exhibition Magiciens de la Terre at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris. The trip took place in 1989 and the painting met with wide acclaim.


"
Jeffrey Smart,"
Jeffrey Smart was born in Adelaide on July 26, 1921, as the only son of Francis Isaac Smart, a real estate agent and his second wife, Emmeline Mildred (nee Edson). His elder half-sister was from his father’s first marriage. He first travelled to Europe when he was a child of four, but after the Great Depression destroyed his father’s business, life became more confined. Nevertheless he was able to take Saturday drawing classes from the age of 12. His early interest was in architecture, but financial reality meant that he became a trainee teacher instead. He also attended classes at the South Australian School of Arts and Crafts.He was fortunate that the pioneer modernist, Dorrit Black had returned to Adelaide and it was she who first introduced him to the clean pure lines and cubic forms of modernism. He began teaching school in 1941,the same year he first exhibited with the Royal South Australian Society of Arts. He then approached a Melbourne commercial gallery, where he held his first solo exhibition. His clear-toned smooth painted geometric urban landscapes, where human figures sometimes appear as an intrusion, led him to be seen as an inoffensive modernist, an artist who could straddle both the Charm School and Surrealism.He first travelled to Europe as an adult in 1948. His experience of the great European collections, especially the work of Cezanne which he saw in Paris,and the work of the Quattrocento Italian artists helped mature his own vision. Smart returned to Adelaide in 1951 and after he was awarded the Commonwealth Jubilee Art Prize he moved to Sydney, where there were opportunities to exhibit his art.In Sydney he became the art critic of the Daily Telegraph, while continuing to support himself by working as a school teacher. Later he became the beloved Phidias, the art expert, at the ABC Radio children’s Argonauts program. Later he made the transition to television. As he became more successful as an artist Smart was able to leave school teaching and taught for a short time at East Sydney Technical College.In 1963 he was able to leave teaching and relocate to Italy where he was based for the rest of his life. Although he was surrounded by antiquity, the subjects he chose for his art tended to be those from modernity. He was entranced by the giant cubic shapes of industrial containers, empty streets, the absurd conjunction of old and new, of nature meeting geometry.Smart continued to exhibit in Australia for the rest of his life. He held exhibitions in public galleries as well as dealer galleries, and he was the subject of significant public praise. The Art Gallery of New South Wales held a retrospective exhibition of his paintings in 1999.As with many of his generation, Smart was hesitant at first to declare his sexuality, but later wrote a memoir, Not Quite Straight. His longest, and most loving relationship was with a fellow artist, Ermes de Zan who was with him from 1976 until he died.


"
Joshua Smith,"
(William) Joshua Smith (b. 1905 March 12, Sydney, NSW; d 1995 July 22, Sydney). Known as Joshua Smith, or 'Josh’ to his friends. Traditional painter in oils, and a teacher.
Not to be confused with Josh Smith, a modern New York (USA) artist.
Career
Smith is best known for his portraits, but also created many still life and landscape paintings. His career as a portrait painter was interrupted by World War II, during which he worked as a camouflage artist with Douglas Annand , James Cook, William Dobell , Adrien Feint , Donald Friend , and Robert Emerson Curtis who was their foreman.. From 1967 to 1972, Smith taught portraiture at the Royal Art Society of NSW. He became dissatisfied and left to set up his own school at Lane Cove. Most of his students followed him.. Soon afterward, he appointed his former student Yve Close as assistant teacher. After Smith died in 1995, the school continued for ten years under Close’s direction, until family illness caused her to close it.
Studies
Smith studied drawing and painting with E.M. Smith and sculpture with Rayner Hoff at East Sydney Technical College; drawing and painting at Sydney Art School (now The Julian Ashton Art School), briefly with Julian Ashton , and eight years with Henry C. Gibbons. From 1937 he studied drawing with Adelaide Perry.
Influences
Early and life-long influences were George Washington Lambert , W.B. McInnes, Sir William Orpen and Augustus John. Smith’s sketch- and note-books indicate immense lifelong interest in many artists, such as the old masters Rembrandt, Velazquez, El Greco, Hals and Ribera; and, from the late 1960s, contemporary artists such as Gris and Picasso; and many more. French Impressionists and post-Impressionists broadened Smith’s attitude, especially Cézanne (with landscape) and Lautrec (with portraiture). Australian artist Ivor Hele , who became a friend about 1967, had a strong and lasting influence on Smith’s work.
Painting Style
Smith’s style was traditional, using artists’-quality oils on canvas or hardboard. His preliminary work, at the commencement of a portrait, consisted of a pencil or oil sketch, at times using Chinese White or white chalk on black or brown paper. Smith then enlarged this study to the desired size, using the grid system. Some landscape and still life paintings were approached similarly.When painting on hardboard, he sometimes glued on additional lengths or widths in order to expand the composition. One painting, a finalist in the 1977 Archibald prize, consisted of eleven joined pieces.
He used the following colours, arranged on his palette from left to right: French Ultramarine Blue, Cobalt Blue, Viridian, Cadmium Green, White (Titanium, Flake or Permalba), Cadmium Yellow, Cadmium Yellow Pale, Transparent Gold Ochre, Burnt Sienna, Terra Rosa, Cadmium Red, Alizarin Crimson, and Ivory Black. In earlier paintings he used Chrome Yellow instead of Cadmium Yellow Pale. He introduced Rowney Rose for floral studies and women’s garments.
Typical signature: Joshua Smith in script letters, with the last two digits of the year underneath. (e.g. Joshua Smith 86). For several years from 1938, he signed some paintings Josh, Joshua or J.S., still using the last two digits of the year
Works
Smith’s known works include 543 oils, from c. 1924 to 1995; 179 major drawings, five linocuts, and three portrait sculptures. Numerous previously unknown works in private collections have come to light since 1995. He was a finalist in the Archibald Prize 45 times, having entered a total of 65 portraits.
He is represented in the National Gallery of Australia and the National Portrait Gallery, the National Library, Australian War Memorial, and Federal Parliament, Canberra; the Art Gallery of New South Wales; the Art Gallery of South Australia; Queensland Art Gallery; Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery (Launceston, Tasmania); Bathurst Regional Art Gallery (NSW); Rockhampton Art Gallery (Qld); the University of Western Australia, and numerous corporate and private collections. He was represented in the Art of Australia Exhibition sponsored by the Carnegie Corporation and the Museum of Modern Art, shown widely in the USA and Canada.
Recognition
Awards included: 1937, the Sydney Sesquicentenary Prize for 'Best Drawing in any Medium’; 1944, the Archibald Prize; 1962, the Blue Mountains City Art Prize; 1988, The Royal Agricultural Society Easter Show Exhibition, Portrait Section (for portrait of Lloyd Rees, now in Bathurst Regional Art Gallery); 1985, Peter Sparks Memorial Pastel Award; and 1988, Highly Commended in the Doug Moran Portrait Competition.
Smith was an exhibiting member of the NSW Society of Artists from 1930, a Fellow of the Royal Art Society of NSW from 1953, and a member of Drummoyne Municipal Art Society (now Drummoyne Art Society).
Personal
Smith was unmarried. For most of his adult life, he lived alone in his parental home in Earlwood (Sydney).
Smith had a long association with artist Yve Close. She commenced studies with him in 1973 at his Lane Cove School and, within one year, Smith appointed her as assistant teacher. Under his guidance, they painted murals in a Balmain church which led to her becoming his associate and painting partner, a partnership which lasted for 20 years. During his final illness Close, together with her family, took care of him.

Wes Stacey,
Constance Stokes,"
painter, was born into an upper middle class family at Miram Piram in Victoria’s Wimmera district, daughter of James Henry Parkin and Mary Jane, née Martin. In 1918, when she was 12 the family moved to Melbourne and later studied at the National Gallery School under Bernard Hall.In 1929 she was awarded the Travelling Scholarship, which led her to London, where she studied at the Royal Academy School. A journey to Paris introduced her to contemporary French art, and after working with André Lhote her style dramatically changed to be influenced by Post Impressionism and Cubism. After returning to Melbourne she held her first exhibition in 1933 just after she married Eric Wyborn Stokes. Soon after their marriage the couple travelled on an extended visit to Europe and she took extra anatomy classes at the Royal Academy.On their return to Melbourne, the demands of married life and the birth of her three children served to restrict her art for many years. She did however exhibit at the first exhibition of the Contemporary Art Society in 1939 and later maintained contact with George Bell through his Thursday night drawing classes. She described herself at this time as ‘half mother and half painter. In 1953 her work was selected for an exhibition of Australian art at the New Burlington Galleries in London.In 1964, two years after her husband’s death, she held the first of many solo exhibitions. In her last years the renewed interest in work by women artists led to her work being included in a number of survey exhibitions. Her final painting, Alice Tumbling Down the Rabbit Hole, was completed in 1990, the year before her death.


"
Tim Storrier,"
In 1968, at age 19, and as the youngest artist ever to be awarded the Sulman Prize, Tim Storrier’s work was afforded a level of public acclaim that was unique in Australia for an artist of his generation. This prestigious award provided a career beginning, which, three decades on, he has successively built upon to establish himself as one of Australia’s most respected and sought-after artists.
To many, Tim Storrier is the contemporary Australian painter who most poignantly conveys the unyielding essence of the Australian landscape: its vast melancholy, its primacy over and beyond all human intervention. As no other artist, Storrier’s oeuvre has encompassed the subtlety of the Australian landscape’s fugitive moods, the silently unfolding vibrancy of its droning expanse. He has searchingly recorded his most personal, intuitive responses to the place of his birthright and his ongoing source and subject for creative revisitation. In recent years, Storrier’s subject matter has extended into a new poetic vein, through two series depicting the spectre of the luminescent southern sky and the impenetrable green ocean.
Tim Storrier has been represented in many prestigious exhibitions, including the Australian Bicentennial Exhibition, Fischer Fine Art, London (1988); 'Windows on Australia 1’, Australian Embassy, Tokyo (1995); 'The Australian Experience’, Galerie Konoha, Japan (1996); and 'The Rose Crossing’ touring exhibition (1999-2000). 'Tim Storrier Drawings 1971-2003’ and 'Dust and Ashes’ were held at Sherman Galleries in 2003.
Tim Storrier has been collected by all major Australian art museums and is included in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. In 1989, he was appointed a Trustee of the Art Gallery of New South Wales; in 1994, he was awarded the Order of Australia AM for his services to art; and in May 2003, he received a Doctor of Arts (Hons) from Charles Sturt University, New South Wales.


"
David Strachan,"
David Edgar Strachan was born on 25 June 1919, at Salisbury in England. His mother was Eleanor Margery Isobel Strachan née Tapp of Bath, his father, Dr James Charles Power Strachan,  had been a major in the Royal Australian Medical Corps. In 1920 he travelled to Australia, first to his father’s home in Adelaide and then to the old gold mining town of Creswick in Victoria where Dr Strachan became the town doctor. Dr Strachan’s patients included the elderly widowed Jane Elizabeth Lindsay, her daughters and her son Robert. Norman, Lionel and Percy Lindsay were the town’s most famous sons, and their many activities were the stuff of local legend. The youngest Lindsay boy, Daryl was a frequent visitor with his wife the novelist Joan Lindsay. Mrs Strachan in particular befriended Mary Lindsay, so young David was early embedded into a culture where art was a suitable career path.After attending Geelong Grammar school, the 16 year old David travelled to England with his mother, where he enrolled in the Slade School of Fine Art for two years. Here he met and befriended Godfrey Miller. In 1937 he travelled to France where he attended summer classes at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière in Paris and travelled south to paint at Cassis on the Riviera. On his return to Australia in 1938 he enrolled in classes at the George Bell School. In 1941 Strachan moved to Sydney, where there were other artists who shared his interest in classical form and mythologies. He lived at first on the top floor of the home of the artist Jean Bellette and her husband the influential art critic Paul Haefliger. Along with many other artists in their circle they travelled to the picturesque abandoned gold mining town of Hill End. The lively and supportive artistic community of what became known as the bq). Charm Schoolbq). was contrasted with his war work of painting camouflage against possible Japanese bomb attacks.At the end of the War he left Australia for Paris, where he joined with former Sydney friends, Hélène Kirsova and Peter Bellew, who was working for UNESCO. Bellew had included Strachan in an exhibition at the Musée National d’Art Moderne two years earlier, and his work was well received. In 1950 Strachan began to experiment with printmaking, both making individual prints and publishing artists’ books. Along with Alister Kershaw and Jacques Murray he founded Stramur-Presse which printed etchings and lithographs by other artists as well as their own work in exquisite artists’ books. He maintained close friendships with others in the Australian expatriate community including the Haefligers at their Majorca home and undertook extensive painting trips with Moya DyringBy the late 1950s Strachan was increasingly interested in Jungian psychology and spend most of 1957 and 1958 at the C. G. Jung-Institut in Zürich. He returned to Australia in 1960 and in 1963 bought a house in Paddington. The food he made at his Paddington home formed aspects of his carefully considered subject matter. He also became an inspirational teacher of printmaking to young students at East Sydney Technical College, and helped foster a new Australian generation of artists in print.His starkly elegant landscapes and symbolist inspired still-lives were not fashionable with the avant-garde, but remained highly regarded by the Trustees of the Art Gallery of New South Wales,who twice awarded him the Wynne Prize. He did not forget his Creswick past, but when he painted landscapes of abandoned gold mines, his paintings were based on Hill End in NSW, not Creswick in Victoria. His last major painting, Lewers Freehold Mine, an historical re-imagining of what the mine may have looked like in 1874, was given by him to the Creswick Historical Society to honour his late father.David Strachan was returning to Sydney from presenting this work when he died after a motor accident on the Hume Highway on 23 November 1970.

Graham Taylor,"
Noongar artist Graham (Swag) Taylor was born in 1955 in Merredin, which is in the wheatbelt region of south Western Australia. He signs his paintings with the name Swag, and this is the name used by those who own or are familiar with his work. Swag is a member of the Baladong people of the southwest, and also has family connections with the Pilbara region. As a child he lived on the Jureen Rock Reserve (just to the northeast of the town of Kellerberrin), which at that time consisted simply of humpies and an ablution block. When he was thirteen years old, Swag was taken away from the reserve and placed in Roelands Mission, where he remained for two years. His early teenage years were spent in the region around Kellerberrin. In a conversation with the author (2009), Swag spoke of being an enthusiastic drawer at school and of being inspired by the Western Arrernte artist Albert Namatjira while he was at high school. He sold his first oil painting in his teens when he was living with his auntie in Merredin. They had no money for food, and having found some oil paint in a rubbish tip, Swag made a painting which he sold to a local publican for $30 – a large amount of money in those days.  At the age of seventeen, Swag spent four and a half months in Fremantle Prison for having committed a minor theft to get food. Amongst the older generation of inmates at that time were Revel Cooper, Goldie Kelly and Lewis Jetta, all of whom were accomplished Noongar artists who painted regularly during their time in prison, and often taught painting techniques to younger inmates. Cooper and Kelly were among the renowned Carrolup children artists who, under the guidance of teachers Noel and Lily White, created landscapes of the country around the settlement that were widely exhibited in Australia and overseas during the late 1940s and early 1950s. Swag recalls watching and learning from the older painters during his brief time at Fremantle Prison, and they and the Carrolup 'school’ style have been an ongoing source of inspiration for him.Other artists who have influenced Swag are Lance Chadd and Shane Pickett. It was Geoffrey Narkle (half-brother of Goldie Kelly) who encouraged him to pursue art seriously in 1984, after visiting Swag’s home in Katanning and seeing the murals he had painted on his walls. Narkle and Swag would go on to become very close friends. Swag’s art practice was nurtured further when he and his wife worked at the Marribank Family Centre (the site of the old Carrolup mission), which in the late 1980s housed a thriving art cooperative. Swag created paintings and ceramics while at Marribank, and continued to exhibit and sell work when he moved to Perth in 1987. Swag paints portraits, landscapes, native animals, and scenes that recollect his childhood experiences, both those from his happy days as a child in the bush and those associated with his harrowing time in the mission. He works with a range of media, including acrylic, oil and enamel paints. He has also created paintings on paperbark. In 2008 Swag’s mother discovered a paperbark work from 1987 in a secondhand shop in Bunbury. She bought it because it was similar in style to her son’s work, but only realised later when she showed it to Swag’s brother that it had in fact been painted by Swag. With respect to the depiction of Noongar country, Swag related to the author that it is important to “paint it as you see it”. This aesthetic philosophy reflects both the legacy of the Carrolup school and the influence of Albert Namatjira’s watercolour works. A defining moment in Swag’s life came in 1983 when he toured Australia with a gospel group for three and a half months. The tour involved visiting regional Aboriginal communities across the nation and Swag was inspired by the diversity of landscapes and the richness of the colours he saw on his travels. He was exposed to a variety of Aboriginal art forms during the tour, but was most strongly attracted to the Namatjira school paintings he saw in an Alice Springs gallery. He identified with their naturalistic style because it is a form of painting founded in “visualising where we want to be in country” (Taylor Pers. Comm. 2009). In 2007 Swag participated in the exhibition 'saltwaterfreshwater’ at the Central TAFE Art Gallery in Perth. One of his works included in the show was Tijnang Koomba Kep (Look Big Water), which imagines how Bunbury may have looked prior to settlement. In an artist’s statement for the exhibition, Swag writes: “I was sent to Roelands Mission, as a child I used to walk to the top of the hills and look towards Bunbury, the place where my Great Grandmother was born.” In his Artlink review of the show, McLean writes of the work: “Painted in the magic realist style of Nyoongar [Noongar] landscape painting, it has a melancholy mood as if the artist’s memories of good times are soured by the crushing loss of what has happened since” (2007). The painting Mission Boy (2008), in which a small boy stands in a bare room looking up to a window high above his head, is a memorial to the trauma and longing Swag experienced at Roelands Mission. In conversation with the author (2009), Swag described the moment that is being recalled in this work: he and two other children had run away from the mission, walking approximately 80 kilometres northeast to Darkan, and then hitchhiking on the road to Williams before being picked up and taken to a police station. Upon being returned to Roelands Mission, Swag was given a hiding and left for many hours alone in a large gymnasium with bare walls and high windows. Swag recalls the sense of desolation he felt in that room, and his painting shows the dirty marks left on the wall by his bare feet as he tried to climb up to look out the window at the other children playing in the yard. He has a strong memory of fearing further trouble when his dirty feet marks were discovered. This work was shortlisted for the 25th Telstra National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards (2008) and included in the exhibition 'The Legacy of Koorah Coolingah’ (2009) at the Brisbane Powerhouse, an exhibition that juxtaposed historical works made by the Carrolup artists from the collection of the Berndt Museum of Anthropology with the works of contemporary Noongar artists who are affiliated with Mungart Boodja Art Centre and feel strongly connected with the Carrolup legacy. After creating Mission Boy, Swag produced several paintings based around the story Follow the Rabbit Proof Fence written by Doris Pilkington Garimara (1996) and subsequently made into a film. The story narrates the escape by three Noongar girls from Moore River Native Settlement. Swag identifies strongly with the girls’ experiences. In 2008 these paintings were exhibited at the Aboriginal art exhibition which is staged annually during the Tom Hoad Cup (an international water polo competition) at the Melville Water Polo Club in Bicton, Western Australia. This exhibition series was initiated by Larry Foley, a dedicted supporter and collector of Noongar art who owns a number of Swag’s works.Other exhibitions in which Swag has participated include 'Noongar Boodja: Contemporary Aboriginal Art, Ecology and Culture’ (2008), in which he exhibited alongside Athol Farmer and Troy Bennell at the Samuel Dorsky Museum of Art in New York, and 'Noongar Koort Boodja – Noongar Heart Land’ (2009) at the University Club of Western Australia. In 2008 he won the Worsley Alumina Indigenous Art Acquisition Award, which saw his work enter the City of Bunbury Art Collection. Alongside his art practice, Swag has worked for many years in the mining and civil works sector as a machine operator. He has been heavily involved in AFL football, coaching football clubs and supporting younger generations of his family in establishing their sporting careers. In 2009 he was living in Perth with his family.

Ken Thaiday,"
Darnley Islander, Ken Thaiday Jr. was born in 1971 in Gordonvale, North Queensland. His father, Ken Thaiday Snr taught him of his Torres Strait Islander culture, history and traditions. It is from these stories that Thaiday Jr has drawn his inspiration, re-interpreting them into his drawings, sculptures and lino prints.
Thaiday Jr was featured in the 1996 exhibition, 'Linkage/Leakage’ curated by Kick Arts Inc., in Cairns and in also in 'ILAN PASIN: Torres Strait Art’ at the Cairns Regional Gallery in 1998. In 2001 his work was included in the exhibition “Gatherings, Contemporary Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art from Queensland, Australia” and it is from the accompanying Gatherings catalogue that Thaiday Jr states that he wants people “to look at my artwork and see it is unique and that it explains Torres Strait Islander culture and Christianity.”

Christian Thompson,"
Christian Thompson was born in Gawler, South Australia, in 1978. He is a Bidjara man of the Kunja Nation from central western Queensland and is also of German-Jewish heritage. His mother’s family are from Gundagai in New South Wales. As an artist, Thompson spurns classification both in terms of style, medium, time, occupation, history and heritage. At the time of writing (2008) he was living in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.Thompson graduated from RMIT in Melbourne with a Master of Fine Arts in 2004. In 2008 he was studying at, and involved in the DasArts Advanced Studies in Performing Arts programme in Amsterdam (The Netherlands). His art practice is multi-disciplinary, encompassing textile based sculpture, photography, installation, performance, video and sound. Thompson’s art practice is distinctive within Australia’s art scene, as an Aboriginal artist raised in the 1980s his work absorbs the influences of that time. Elements of pop culture, dance, fashion, performance and mass media combine with the relationship between objects, space and history. His work engages the viewer and challenges our understanding of Australian identity and what it means to 'be’ Australian.Thompson has exhibited nationally and internationally, he has participated in pivotal curated exhibitions such as 'Culture Warriors’ (2007) the inaugural National Indigenous Art Triennial held at the National Gallery of Australia, curated by Brenda L Croft; and also 'Half Light: Portraits from Black Australia’ (2008) an exhibition of key contemporary Indigenous artists working in photo-media, curated by Hetti Perkins at the Art Gallery of New South Wales.
Thompson has work held in the permanent collections of the National Gallery of Australia, the National Gallery of Victoria, the Art Gallery of NSW and the Aboriginal Art Museum in Utrecht, Netherlands.

Imants Tillers,"
Imants Tillers was a student at The University of Sydney when he participated with Christo and Jeanne-Claude in the Wrapped Coast project at Little Bay, Sydney. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science, Architecture Degree (Hons) and the University Medal in 1973, the year of his first solo exhibition at Watters Gallery. In 1975, Tillers was included in the XIII Bienal de São Paulo.
Since the early 1980s, Imants Tillers has worked almost exclusively on a program of works comprising small individual canvasboards, conceived as part of his major opus, The Book of Power – an ongoing hybrid sequence of appropriations, the core motivation of which is to invert the outmoded, if still prevailing order of centre to province, coloniser to colony, overlord to underdog, and to assert the artist’s identity.
Widely regarded within Australia as the most important artist of his generation, with representation in the Biennale of Sydney (1979, 1986, 1988) and Australian Perspecta (1981, 1987-89), Imants Tillers has been represented in major international exhibitions, including Documenta 7, Kassel, Germany (1982) and the 42nd Biennale of Venice (1986). Tillers’s work has also been represented at such prestigious venues as the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London; Los Angeles County Museum, US; the Guggenheim Museum, New York; the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford, UK; the National Museum of Seoul, Korea; Neues Museum Weserburg Bremen; and London’s Serpentine Gallery.
Major solo survey exhibitions of Tillers’s work have been presented at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London (1988); the National Art Gallery, Wellington, NZ (1989); the National Art Museum, Riga, Latvia (1993); the Pori Art Museum, Finland (1995); the Museum of Contemporary Art in Monterrey, Mexico (1999-2000); and the National Gallery of Australia (2006).
Imants Tillers’s awards and commissions include the Dome of the Federation Pavilion, Centennial Park, Sydney (1985-87); the Founding Donors Commission, entrance lobby, Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney (1991); and The Attractor and Eight Women, Sydney Olympic Park (2002). Principal among his international awards are Japan’s Osaka Triennale Grand Prize (1993) and the inaugural Beijing International Art Biennale Prize for Excellence (2003).
Tillers has an extensive bibliography, including the Wystan Curnow publication, Imants Tillers and the 'Book of Power’ (Craftsman House, G+B Art International, 1998); Graham Coulter-Smith’s, The Postmodern Art of Imants Tillers: Appropriation 'en abyme’ , 1971-2001 (London, 2002); The Oxford History of Western Art (OUP, 2000) and The 20th Century Art Book (Phaidon, London, 1996).

Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri,"
Born c. 1932 at Napperby Station. Language/tribe Anmatyerre. His father was born at the site of Ngarlu (Ngwerritye Alatiye) west of Mt Allan. His mother came from Warlugulong, south west of Yuendumu. The name Possum was given to Clifford by his paternal grandfather. Clifford received no formal education, growing up “in the bush” and then at Jay Creek during the late 1940s. He did stockwork at various stations across the Centre including Hamilton Downs, Glen Helen, Mt Wedge, Mt Allan and Napperby. One of last men to join Geoffrey Bardon’s group of 'painting men’ at the beginning of the 1970s – with the encouragement of his brother Tim Leura Tjapaltjarri.
Clifford Possum was already a woodcarver of reknown, and had been employed at Papunya School teaching woodcarving to the children and was Chairman of Papunya Tula Artists during the early 1980s. During the ’70s and ’80s, he and his family lived at Papunya, Napperby Station, M’bunghara outstation near Glen Helen, and then Alice Springs. Subsequently, Clifford divided his time between Alice Springs amd the homes of his daughters Gabrielle Possum and Michelle Possum (who are both painters) in Melbourne, Adelaide and Kempsey on the NSW Central Coast. He also travelled widely in Australia and to Europe and North America.
Clifford Possum’s country was around Mt Wedge (Kerrinyarra), Napperby station (Tjuirri) and Mt Allan and his vast repertoire of Dreaming stories included Possum, Fire, Water, Kangaroo, Fish, Snake, Man’s Love Story, Lightning, Mala, Goanna etc. He died in Alice Springs on June 21 2002, the day he was to have been awarded his AO.


"
Ellen Trevorrow,"
Ellen Trevorrow, Ngarrindjeri weaver, was born at Point McLeay ( Raukkan ) in 1955 and raised near Tailem Bend. Tailem Bend is a small town in the Murraylands region of South Australia, and Trevorrow spent her childhood in fringe dwellers camps just outside of the town with her grandmother, Ellen Brown, from whom she gets her name. She attended primary school in Tailem Bend, and moved South to Bonney Reserve near Meningie when she was 11 and went on to complete high school. She met her husband to be, Tom Trevorrow, when she was fourteen. They were married in 1976 and went on to have seven children. They have remained in or near Meningie ever since.
Trevorrow had watched her grandmother weave when she was a child, however her own weaving practice only began in 1982 when she attended a workshop which was facilitated by Steve Hemming of the South Australian Museum, with Aunty Dorrie Kartinyeri, an elder from Point McLeay. Kartinyeri showed the workshop participants how to weave, where to find the rushes, and how to prepare them properly for weaving. Prior to colonisation, weaving had an important practical purpose in Ngarrindjeri culture. During the days of the Point McLeay Mission, Aboriginal women were encouraged to treat their weavings as a source of income and Allen writes that 'During the mid-1800s and the early twentieth century, the women at Point McLeay were famous for the baskets they made to sell’ (Allen, L. in B. Parkes (ed) 2005,  p. 95). Kartinyeri initiated the workshop as one of the few Ngarrindjeri women who knew the craft. As Trevorrow writes in correspondence with the author: 'Auntie Dorrie must have felt that she had to pass on the knowledge of Ngarrindjeri weaving while she still could’ (pers. comm. 2009). The workshop was also attended by Yvonne Koolmatrie who, like Trevorrow, went on to devote her life to weaving as both a practitioner and teacher.
Trevorrow regards herself as a 'cultural weaver’ to emphasise that her practice is about cultural regeneration and affirmation, as opposed to being a purely artistic preoccupation (Conroy, D. in  in S. Kleinert & M. Neale (eds) 2000,  p. 722). She and her husband have been foundation members of Camp Coorong Race Relations Cultural Education Centre since 1985. Camp Cooring is located close to Meningie, adjacent to the site of Bonney Reserve. It is situated within the Coorong, a coastal ecosystem of estuaries, lakes and lagoons where the Murray River meets the sea. Trevorrow has a deep sense of attachment to the Murray River, which constitutes part of her Ngarrindjeri Clan Group’s Traditional Country. Through guided field trips, talks and cultural workshops, visitors to Camp Coorong are educated about the complex nature of the Coorong and its wildlife, and on the importance of the Coorong in Ngarrindjeri Culture. Trevorrow regularly teaches weaving workshops at the camp, and also holds workshops at schools, festivals and institutions. She finds great pleasure in teaching both adults and children and regards the intimate, sharing social environment that is brought into being as one of the most valuable aspects of the weaving: “It’s extremely satisfying to sit and yarn while you weave together. I like weaving with old people because they yarn about things, the past which is the future for their children. Sometimes special stories are revealed, it’s good to share and exchange” (personal communication 2009).
Trevorrow began exhibiting her weavings in the late 1980s. Among her first group exhibitions were 'Ngarrindjeri Art and Craft’ at the South Australian Museum (1987) and 'River’ at Artspace, Adelaide Festival Centre (1989). Other exhibitions have included 'Aboriginal Women’s Exhibition’ at the Art Gallery of NSW (1991), 'talking. listening’ at Artspace, Adelaide Festival Centre (1994) and 'Tactility’ at the National Gallery of Australia (2003).Trevorrow is well known for her 'Sister’ baskets. A Sister basket is so-called because it comprises two identical baskets joined together around the edges with sedge twine, with an opening left at the top. Historically, the Sister basket or Nakal as it is known in the Ngarrindjeri language is used to collect herbs and carry small personal objects. Trevorrow and her husband worked out the technique for creating a Sister basket after they examined an historical example in the collection of the Camp Coorong Museum which was made by Ethel Whympie, Tom Trevorrow’s great-grandmother. Sister baskets made by Trevorrow are in the collection of the Art Gallery of South Australia and the Migration museum in Adelaide. For the 1997 exhibition 'The Somatic Object’ at the Ivan Dougherty Gallery in Sydney, Trevorrow’s work was an interpretation of the Seven Sisters Dreaming Story, a story that the Ngarrindjeri share with Indigenous groups of the Western Desert. With the encouragement of Canberra artist Wendy Dodd, Trevorrow made seven Sister baskets that formed an installation for the exhibition.Trevorrow’s baskets, as well as her other woven forms such as fish scoops and mats, are made from thin bundles of sedge grasses, which are freshwater rushes that grow in sandy soil in the Coorong, surrounding Lakes and River Murray waterways. The bundles are held together with a single reed which is wrapped around them as they are coiled into shape, and which stitches the coils to each other as the weave progresses. Sedge grasses used to grow prolifically along the Murray River and in the Coorong, however due to prolonged drought and intensive irrigation upstream, the flow of water to the mouth of the river and into the Coorong has declined dramatically. As a result, the freshwater rushes grow far more sparsely, their growth stunted by the rising salt water table. Trevorrow collects the rushes from Lake Alexandria, near Poltalloch Station, but always leaves clumps to ensure regrowth, and in some areas plants the seeds of the rushes to ensure a continuous supply. Both Trevorrow and her husband have sought to publicise the environmental damage that is being done to the Coorong, Lakes and River Murray, and Camp Coorong and Trevorrow’s weaving workshops are an integral part of this effort.


"
Albert Tucker,"
He was born in Melbourne, on 29 December 1914. His grandfather and namesake Albert Lee Tucker, MLA, was mayor of Fitzroy. By the time Albert was born his father, John Tucker, was working on railway maintenance. His mother Clara (née Davis) was aspirational, but with insufficient income the family found life difficult. Albert left school young and worked at subsistence jobs. By 1934 he was working at John Vickery’s commercial art studio in Collins Street and drawing freelance for women’s magazines. This brought him into contact with Melbourne’s creative artistic community, including the young modernist Sam Atyeo, and the conservative Sir John Longstaff. In 1933 he began attending evening classes at the Victorian Artists Society (VAS).  Other evenings were spent at the old reading room of the State Library. He also haunted Gino Nibbi’s Leonardo Bookshop, and befriended the proprietor. Tucker exhibited for the first time at the VAS in 1933. A self portrait of 1937 attracted the attention of the Herald's art critic, Basil Burdett, and he left his full-time job. The same year he took some classes at the George Bell school but soon left,preferring to direct his own learning. Along with Bell and other discontented artists Tucker became a founding member of the Contemporary Art Society in 1938. In 1939 he bought a second hand camera, and it his photographs that so memorably records the life of the Angry Penguins circle in the 1940s.Through his friendship with Harry de Hartog and others he became involved in the Artists’ Branch of the Communist Party. From the late 1930s, Tucker’s art was increasingly influenced by Surrealism. His interest was endorsed by the art he saw in the 1939 Herald  Exhibition of French and British Contemporary Art, which featured works by Dali, Ernst, de Chirico and Picasso.In 1938 he became romantically involved with Joy Hester, an art student from  the National Gallery School who began attending Victorian Artists Society life drawing classes, and in 1939 they moved in together. Tucker and Hester married on 1 January 1941. By this time John and Sunday Reed were financially supporting Tucker’s career as well as befriending Hester and encouraging her art. At Heide they were joined by Sidney Nolan, whose ménage à trois with the Reeds was public knowledge.In 1942, after Japan entered the war Tucker enlisted in the medical corps. His status as an artist led to him making illustrations for the officers at the Wangaratta base and after a bout of pneumonia was medically discharged in October 1943. The sight of shell-shocked and profoundly injured soldiers newly returned from the front continued to haunt him for the rest of his life, and coloured the direction of his art.Tucker began to paint works based on his disgust at the sexual promiscuity of young girls in times of war, a concern that evolved into a savage critique of strong female sexuality. 
 Many of his paintings are dominated by a shape based on a full-lipped woman’s mouth, evolving into an agressive lipstick pink crescent, and this shape recurred for the rest of his painting life. After leaving the Army, Tucker worked for a while with Arthur Boyd at his pottery at Murrumbeena, but then resumed work on  bq). Images of Modern Evilbq). , an emotionally searing response to young girls, American soldiers and the War. On 4 February 1945 Joy gave birth to their son Sweeney (although Sunday later claimed that Tucker may not have been the father).In early 1947 Tucker visited Japan, and saw the devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, images that would always stay with him. He met with Japanese artists and painted portraits of American officers to raise money to buy cultured pearls for resale in Australia. On his return from Japan he was told  that Joy had been diagnosed with Hodgkins Disease, and had two years to live. In his absence Joy had met the artist Gray Smith, and when she was told of her illness the marriage was over. Hester left Sweeney with Tucker who left the baby with the Reeds while he considered his future. He was eventually persuaded to allow them to adopt his son. It was a decision Tucker regretted for the rest of his life. He left Australia for England on 9 September 1947. Post-war London was uninspiring, but in Paris he was inspired by the work of Jean Dubuffet. In Paris he was also helped by Peter Bellew who was now working for UNESCO. Tucker visited other European cities, seeing as much art as he could. He was especially impressed with German Expressionism and in 1951 he travelled to Frankfurt-am-Main to join his new companion, Mary Dixon, an American he had met in Paris. The faction fights of the Communist Party in the 1940s and the activities of the Soviet Union had turned Tucker’s political perspective into one of anti-Communism. The landscape that now coloured his perceptions was that of bomb-blasted Germany. The next year they returned to Paris where they lived in a caravan Tucker had built, and later travelled to the south of France and Rome. In November 1953 John Reed withdrew the small stipend he had paid Tucker, causing him considerable financial difficulty. The news coincided with a visit from Sidney and Cynthia Nolan, who advised him of possibilities of the Venice Biennale, where Tucker exhibited in 1956. Nolan also showed Tucker his photographs of animals killed in the Australian drought, imagery that was to provide Tucker with new subject matter.In Rome he befriended the Italian artist Alberto Burri who introduced him to a new adhesive into which he could mix sand and dirt for his Nolan inspired work, completed in London. In 1958 Dixon visited California to see her mother, and took some of Tuckers’ work with her. The Museum of Modern Art in New York bought Lunar Landscape – the first purchase by a public collection. His next series, exhibited successfully in London,  Explorers, made craggy despairing images of those explorers who died in the bush.In early 1960 he visited New York where he had successful exhibitions,  was given the free use of a furnished apartment, and work was purchased by the Guggenheim. After a further successful London exhibition, he returned home to Australia and held a successful national touring exhibition. His first Melbourne studio was at 9 Collins Street, the same building as Tom Roberts. In 1961 he met Barbara Bilcock, who he married in 1964. They bought land at Hurstbridge and built a house and studio. He became a passionate conservationist, but fell out with his old friends by supporting the Americans and the Australian governments in their stance on the Vietnam War.In Melbourne he renewed contact with Sweeney, a brilliant but troubled young man who made art as well as running commercial art galleries, subsidised by his adoptive parents. In 1972 Sweeney Reed Gallery showed the entire series of Images of Modern Evil for the first time. It was a major critical success. Sweeney however could not reconcile the contradictions of his life and on 29 March 1979, in the middle of negotiations to sell Tucker’s early paintings to the National Gallery of Australia he committed suicide.Albert Tucker’s last series of paintings, Faces I have met, was a series of recollected portraits of friends and enemies. It was prompted in part by the revival of interest in his earlier work brought about by James Mollison’s advocacy of it, and academic researchers including Richard Haese and Janine Burke. He died of a heart attack at a private hospital where Barbara had taken him for tests.

Hossein Valamanesh,"
Hossein Valamanesh combines cultural elements from two countries: his native Iran and Australia. The result is sculptural and installation-based work relating to memory, cultural dislocation, loss, and the progression of time. The work, simultaneously strong and subtle, and occasionally playful, has gentle and poetic resonances.
Hossein Valamanesh graduated from the School of Fine Art Painting in Tehran in 1970. He immigrated to Australia in 1973, arriving in Perth and travelling to Central Australia for four months, where he worked with Aboriginal children. In 1975, he began further studies in visual arts at the South Australian School of Art and, since graduating, has exhibited frequently in Australia and overseas, including Germany, Poland and Japan.
Hossein has completed a number of major public art projects in Australia and Japan, most notably for the Tachikawa Project, an urban precinct in Tokyo featuring 110 works by 90 major sculptors. In 1999, he collaborated with Angela Valamanesh to create the Memorial to the Great Irish Famine, An Gorta Mor , at Hyde Park Barracks, Sydney. He was one of the international artists invited to participate in the 2003 Echigo-Tsumari Necklace project organised by Art Front Gallery in Tokyo. Hossein has received numerous awards, including a fellowship residency in Künstlerhaus Bethanien, Berlin (1991) and, more recently, an Australia Council Fellowship. An Art & Australia monograph on his work, written by Paul Carter, was published in 1996. Two years later he won the Grand Prize at the 1998 Dacca Biennale in Bangladesh.
In mid-2001, 'Hossein Valamanesh: A Survey’ was held at the Art Gallery of South Australia; the accompanying catalogue contained essays by Sarah Thomas, Ian North and Paul Carter. In February 2002, 'Tracing the Shadow: Hossein Valamanesh’ was held at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney. Hossein’s work is included in most major public art collections in Australia. In 2006 he was living and working in Adelaide.

Angela Valamanesh,"
Potter, was born in Port Pirie, South Australia. She graduated from the SA School of Art and was awarded her MA (Visual Arts) from the University of South Australia in 1993. In 1996 she won an Anne & Gordon Samstag International Visual Arts Scholarship, spent on a Postgraduate Program at the Glasgow School of Art, Scotland, UK. In 1997 she was awarded a Diploma in Design (Ceramics), South Australian School of Art, Adelaide. Angela is married to Hossein Valamenesh , with whom she has collaborated on several works.
“Angela Valamanesh has an established background as a ceramicist. Birds Have Fled is probably her first major showing as artist rather than craftsperson. Given this background the nature of her success was something of a surprise. The work consists of three or four focal points in an installation that has these spare elements totally dominate a gallery space that regularly defeats even group shows and which, while it permits success, could never be said to aid it.
“The gallery is lit to a softened gloom by the light of the spot-lit elements. These make a more or less cross-bow axis division of the space. To the right is a slightly ajar door, in the middle a large bluely glowing screen wall, a black light-box silhouetted in front of it throws the blue neon light. To the left are a pile of rubble casts and a few feet further to the left a pair of feet, soles outward, just out from the wall’s surface. The lightbox, when one moves to it, carries a Colette text, some lines describing a dream, in which the subject approaches a door that is opened by her identical, younger self. Hence the door some many metres away (right), coolly teasing or foreboding. And the pile in the corner at left turn out to be casts of feet – just the upper forefoot & shin: the part of our own feet we see & know. Once-possible selves, paths not taken. The two soles adjacent indicate a real subject (modelled in beeswax they are finely detailed, with signs of wear, age etcetera), but the surface we cannot so intimately know. We get to know it well in this instance: they’re head height &, in beeswax, intricately delicate. Also a little morgue-like. The gallery’s vast distances are effectively suborned to the interests of the installation, making each element 'far-away’ from the perspective of any other, diminished in scale – yet the lighting has these distances seem psychic, dream-like, not literal.
“The constellation of ideas the work seems to represent are not all that striking, have maybe the feel of rather nineteenth century symbolist clich?. But their expression here is impressively firm. While the themes are not new: Birds Have Fled is impressive in its achieved authority and resonance.”

Ruth Waller,"
painter and illustrator, was born in Sydney on 15 November 1955. She did her Diploma of Art at Alexander Mackie College of Advanced Education, Sydney, 1974-78, and at one stage she designed graphics for the Artworkers Union. House About Wollongong 1985, done as artist-in-residence at Wollongong in 1984-85, is a series of colour photographs of cheap but odd suburban houses and gardens in the district. Her series of paintings of paw prints of the extinct Tasmanian tiger is believed to have been exhibited at the Tin Sheds in the 1980s. From the 1990s to c.2001 Waller lived in Canberra teaching part-time at Canberra School of Art, Australian National University, Canberra, and also researching Renaissance predella painting in Europe with the help of small Australian Research Council grants. She showed a series of paintings related to Italian predella paintings at Watters Gallery in Sydney c.1999, to be followed by German predalla-inspired works in c.2001.

Judy Watson,"
Waanyi artist Judy Watson was born in Mundubbera, Queensland in 1959, and raised in Brisbane. Her fine arts education began in 1977, when she began a two year Diploma of Creative Arts at the Darling Downs Institute of Advanced Education in Toowoomba. She moved to Hobart the following year to undertake a Bachelor of Fine Arts at the University of Tasmania, which she completed in 1982. In 1986 she completed a Graduate Diploma of Visual Arts at Monash University in Gippsland, Victoria.While Watson had shown her work in a number of galleries during her student days, it wasn’t until the late 1980s and early 1990s that she came to be involved in significant exhibitions. Among her first solo shows were 'a sacred place for these bones’ at Griffith University in Brisbane (following a three-month residency there) in 1989 and 'groundwork’ at the Institute of Modern Art, Brisbane in 1990. Early group shows included the seminal exhibition 'A Koori Perspective’ at Artspace, Sydney in 1989, the First Asia Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art, Queensland Art Gallery, 1993 and the 1993 Australian Perspecta at the Art Gallery of New South Wales (AGNSW) – which focused on the work of a range of indigenous Australian artists in recognition of the UN International Year of the Worlds Indigenous People.  Watson specialised in printmaking during her fine art studies, and thus initially favoured works on paper, however she soon diversified her practice to include painting, installation and sculpture. An important early print in which Watson explored her Indigenous heritage was the 1988 etching touching my mother’s blood (National Gallery of Australia). the guardians (1986/87) was one of Watson’s first sculptural works, consisting of large figure-shaped panels adorned with mixed media and powdered pigment, representing the artist’s matrilineal Indigenous ancestors including her great-grandmother, grandmother and mother. This work was purchased for the AGNSW’s collection, and featured in the 'Aratjara: Art of the first Australians’ touring exhibition initiated by the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen in Dusseldorf, in 1993. The theme of women’s connectedness that was explored in the guardians is highly significant for the artist, and the family members, sites and ancestral stories of Watson’s family history have been a foundation of her artistic practice since the early days of her career. A critical turning point came in 1990 when she and her family visited Riversleigh Station in north western Queensland, where her maternal grandmother Grace Isaacson was born. Victoria Lynn, writing for the catalogue of the 1995 'Antipodean Currents’ exhibition held at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, notes that during the visit Watson “researched the history of Aboriginal people and the pastoral industry in the region. Her family showed her bush foods, Spinifex resin, native-bee’s honey (“sugarbag” as it is called colloquially) and rock paintings” (p.106). The creative and emotional resources Watson drew from this visit allowed her to consolidate her artistic language and, as she stated in a 2002 interview with curator Hetti Perkins, published in the book One Sun, One Moon, her practice has remained devoted to an “archeology of memory, history and site” (2007, p. 306).  Watson has said that the stories her grandmother shared with her as a child allowed her to “learn from the ground up – to feel the power of the land under your feet that resonates through your body connecting you to country – but also to feel and acknowledge the pride and empowerment of cultural reclamation” (Watson quoted in T. Mia &amp; S. Morgan’s article “Going home to Country”). As this statement conveys, Watson is often concerned with memorialising the human imprint upon the natural world and reanimating sites by honouring those presences. This was achieved on a grand scale in 1994, when Watson was commissioned to create a permanent installation for the floor of the Casula Powerhouse Arts Centre in Casula, NSW. Formerly a power station, the Art Centre conversion was in the last stages of completion at the time of the commission. Watson consulted with local community groups, conducted research in local land councils, museums and libraries, visited significant sites in the region, and workshopped ideas with Indigenous children and elders from the area to develop a design for the site. The Indigenous artists Cheryl Robinson, Gordon Hookey, Vivian Scott and Brook Andrew assisted Watson in the production of the Casula floor. Watson undertook a similar research and consultation process to produce another commission in 1999: an etched zinc wall encountered when one enters Bunjilaka, the Aboriginal Cultural Centre at the Melbourne Museum. The work was entitled Wurreka, which means “to speak” in the Wemba Wemba language of north-west Victoria, and consists of 74 individually etched panels of zinc, which each contain an image drawn from the Indigenous cultural heritage of south eastern Australia.  Watson adopts a contemplative and experimental approach to the traditional artists’ resources of ink, paint, charcoal, pastels and dry pigment, an approach that reflects her sensibilities as a printmaker. She attends to the way these materials react to each other, and the way different mediums and binders can be employed to achieve distinctive surfaces. Unpredicted effects that result, for instance, from the textures of the earth upon which she often works, the scrubbing away of layers of pigment, or the dried splashes and bubbles of ink, are allowed to dictate the progress of an image. Such processes, and her exploitation of the qualities of canvas as a cloth rather than a mere support for an image, reflect a fidelity to natural processes: the effects are evocative of the unpredictability of environmental and historical forces, and the way the earth retains the memory of layers of events. This approach is evident in the body of work Watson produced for 'Fluent’, the Australian exhibition co-curated by Brenda Croft, Hetti Perkins and Victoria Lynn for the Venice Biennale in 1997 in which Watson’s work was exhibited alongside those of fellow Indigenous women artists Yvonne Koolmatrie and Emily Kame Kngwarreye. Watson has also integrated found materials such as shells, natural oxides and stringy bark into her works. The artist’s style is also marked by a tendency to extrapolate the symbolic and metaphorical resonances of the materials she uses in light of aspects of her own biography, and of the history of human occupation in Australia. As she writes of the work driftnet (1998), included in the 2000 Adelaide Biennial 'Beyond the Pale’, curated by Brenda Croft, it “references the destructive nature of those nets that entrap turtles and dolphins indiscriminately. It also alludes to my practice as an artist, travelling, collecting information, materials and meaning from places other than my own country. It holds the weave, the threads of cultural knowledge, a catcher of thoughts like a spirit net” (quoted in 'Beyond the Pale’ catalogue, p.88). The fact that Waanyi people are known as 'running water people’ is of great importance to the artist, and she evokes the qualities of water in many of her works. Watson has been a committed environmentalist since she shared a home with conservationists as a student in Hobart. When she moved to Townsville after her studies were complete she became a member of the North Queensland Conservation Council, and participated in conservation campaigns concerned with the Daintree Rainforest in Queensland and the Franklin River in Tasmania. In 1995, Watson was awarded the Moët &amp; Chandon fellowship, and two important bodies of work resulted from the associated French residency, the first of which pursued environmental themes. The French government was undertaking nuclear testing in the Pacific at the time of her residency, and Watson produced a series of works articulating her sense of “feeling compromised” by these circumstances, as she explained in an article she wrote for Artlink entitled “Nucleus: Feeling Compromised” (1996). Two paintings from this period: the water boiled and turned white and pacific vessel were among the works selected for the 'In Place (Out of Time) exhibition: Contemporary Art in Australia’ exhibition held at the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford, 1997.  Also included in this exhibition were a series of etchings derived from periods of research undertaken at the Horniman and Science Museum and the British Museum (Museum of Mankind) in the United Kingdom during her French residency. The etchings, now in the collection of the AGNSW, are titled our bones in your collections, our skin in your collection and our hair in your collection (1997). They reflect another key artistic preoccupation for Watson: the racial classification of Indigenous Australians historically, and their fragmented and reified presence within the archival collections of museums around the world. Recurring themes in Watson’s work are shells, middens, termite mounds, vessels, fossils, plants, islands and maps, and these are frequently rendered in a manner that evoke the corporeal: bones, hair, scarred skin and blood. Through this treatment of the body, Watson explores both the human presence within the land and the impact of the malevolent structures of the State upon indigenous Australians. The latter was the theme of her 2005 work a preponderance of aboriginal blood, which resulted from a commission from the State Library of Queensland. The library sought a range of women artists’ responses, in the form of artists’ books, to the history of voting rights in Queensland. This was for the dual purpose of commemorating a century of Queensland women’s suffrage, and 40 years of Indigenous suffrage. a preponderance of aboriginal blood, which consisted of manipulated reproductions of assimilation policy documents splashed with red ink, was awarded the Telstra Work on Paper Award at the 23rd National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards, 2006. In the award documentation Watson is quoted as saying of the archival material: “Its heaviness dictates an era of constriction and control for all Aboriginal people caught within its web.” In 2007 Watson addressed the theme in another artist’s book, but in a more personal register: under the act worked with family photographs and documentary evidence of her grandmother’s and great grandmother’s subjection to Queensland’s Aborigines Protection and the Restriction of Opium Act (1897). This work was included in 'Culture Warriors’, the inaugural Indigenous Art Triennial at the National Gallery of Australia, curated by Brenda Croft (2007). Over the course of her career, Watson has undertaken international residencies in Italy, India, Canada, Norway and France. She has held numerous solo exhibitions in Australia and overseas, and her work is included in the collections of all major state galleries, as well as numerous overseas collections. At the time of writing, several survey shows of Watson’s work have been staged, including 'sacred ground beating heart: works by Judy Watson 1989-2003’, an international touring exhibition initiated by John Curtin Gallery in Perth, and 'Judy Watson: Selected Works 1990-2005’ at the Queensland University Art Museum. In 2006 Watson received the National Gallery of Victoria’s Clemenger Contemporary Art Award.  Watson has held lecturing and tutoring positions at a range of universities, and has also been active in encouraging and assisting other Indigenous artists to research their heritage, access art resources, and develop approaches to creating art works that reflect their history, identity and location. She has undertaken a number of public art commissions subsequent to 'Casula floor piece’ and Wurreka. These include an installation in the Walama forecourt (2000) at the Sydney airport, for which artist Brook Andrew also contributed sculptural works. After consultation with Maningrida weavers in the Northern Territory, Watson designed large corroded steel structures that echo the shapes of dilly bags, termite mounds and sedge grass fences, while she also developed a shell theme for the site in consultation with La Perouse (Sydney) shellwork artist Esme Timbery. Other commissions include Ngarrn-Gi – Land (which means “to know” in the Woiwurrung language of the Wurundjeri people of the Melbourne region), a 50 metre long, three-panelled zinc wall installed in the foyer of the Victorian County Court in 2002, and heart/land/river (2004), which consists of 18 large photographic glass panels with fibre optic lighting, at the Brisbane Magistrate’s Court. In 2005, Watson was selected to produce two works, a glass ceiling and a glass wall facade, that were permanently installed in the Musee du Quai Branly, Paris, which opened in 2006. Watson was among a group of eight indigenous artists whose work was integrated into the architectural fabric of the buildings, the others being Ningura Napurrula, Lena Nyadbi, Michael Riley, Tommy Watson, John Mawurndjul, Paddy Bedford and Gulumbu Yunupingu. After many years living in different parts of Australia and long periods of time overseas, at the time of writing Watson had returned to live in Brisbane with her family.

H. J. Wedge,"
Wiradjuri artist Harry Wedge was born in Cowra, NSW in 1958. Illiterate and largely self-taught, Wedge’s only period of formal training was at Eora College in Sydney between 1989 and 1993. Wedge’s 'outsider’ status has proven to be a creative asset, as he has developed a unique, surreal painterly aesthetic. Working with acrylic paints, he employs garish colours and presents his memories and social commentary in dreamlike, narrative form.
His memories of growing up on Erambie mission are a dominant theme in his work, however he also consistently engages with a wide range of current social and political issues. Wedge has had a long association with Boomalli Aboriginal Artist’s Cooperative, holding his first exhibition there (with Ian Abdulla) in 1991 and participating in many group and solo shows there during the 1990s. His first solo exhibition 'Wiradjuri Spirit Man’ was held at the Tandanya National Aboriginal Culture Centre in Adelaide in 1992. Wedge’s artistic career gained impetus in 1993 when he was artist in residence at the Art Gallery of New South Wales, and his work was included in the Australian Perspecta and the 25th Budapest Autumn Festival. In that year he was also awarded the NSW Ministry for the Arts Indigenous Arts Fellowshi
Significant group exhibitions have included Urban Focus in 1994 (National Gallery of Australia), 'True Colours’ in 1994 (Boomalli and touring internationally), the 2002 Sydney Biennale and the Inaugural National Indigenous Art Triennial 'Culture Warriors’ in 2007 (NGA).

Trevor Weekes,"
Painter, sculptor and works on paper artist. Born in Orange, NSW, in 1951, Trevor Weekes lives and works in Newcastle, NSW. Weekes has studied the National Art School and Canberra School of Art. Between 1976-78 he studied a Diploma in Art at the Alexander Mackie School of Advanced Education. In 1994 Weekes graduated with a Masters in Fine Arts from the College of Fine Arts, University of New South Wales, and in 1999 he received his Doctorate of Philosophy from the University of Newcastle, NSW.
Weekes is inspired by animals’ ability to adapt and evolve to ever changing environments. In 2005 Weekes spent time in France at Zootheque, the Natural History Museum’s archive, which houses over eighty thousand bird specimens. While there he produced over five hundred sketches of birds. His resulting body of sculptures and paintings were based on hybrid and fantastical species of birds – birds which exist in the infinite possibilities of nature’s (and Weekes’) imagination.
To date, Weekes has had over twenty-five solo exhibitions since 1979 and he has exhibited in over forty group exhibitions. He has completed many commissions and is represented in numerous collections, including Artbank, Burnie Art Gallery, College of Fine Arts, John Darnell Collection, Hamilton Regional Gallery, Muswellbrook Regional Art Gallery, Macquarie University, Newcaslte Region Art Gallery, New England Regional Art Museum, South Australian College of Advanced Education, State Bank of New South Wales, The Australian National Gallery, The Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences, The Visual Arts Board, Toowoomba Rotary Club, Wagga Wagga Art Gallery, Lake Macquarie Regional Art Gallery, the University of Newcastle, Araluen Arts Centre, as well as private collections in the USA, Britain, Spain and Australia.

Cathy Wilcox,"
cartoonist, was born in Sydney on 11 June 1963, the youngest of three children. She has drawn all her life and made caricatures of her classmates at school. While completing her BA in Visual Communications at Sydney College of the Arts, she worked at David Jones and met Jenny Coopes as a customer, who agreed to look at her work. This led to a spot as temporary replacement at the Sydney Morning Herald and her first published cartoons in 1984. She went to Paris for three years in 1985, where she worked as an illustrator and studied. After returning to Sydney in 1987, she began illustrating children’s books and in 2002 had illustrated 17 of them, including her own Enzo the Wonderfish .
Wilcox became resident cartoonist for the 'Stay in Touch’ back page in the Sydney Morning Herald from January 1989, following Reg Lynch and Matthew Martin (the latter again an occasional contributor in c.1993-97). Since 1993 she has been employed as the political cartoonist on the Age . Her small cartoons, and occasionally her large editorial cartoons, also appear regularly in its sister Fairfax publication, the Sydney Morning Herald . (Since late 1995 she has from time to time filled in for Alan Moir and provided the main cartoon on the Herald editorial page.)
A member of the Australian Black and White Artists’ Club, Wilcox won Stanleys for Best Editorial/Political Cartoonist and Best Single Gag Artist in 1994 (see SMH 31 October 1994, 5). With Kerry Millard she was runner-up for the Single Gag Artist’s Stanley in 1996, won by Glen Le Lievre . Her cartoons, Keep my seat warm published SMH 3 January 1997, Try your luck , Conscience Vote [on euthanasia] and Downer’s Dilemma published Age 15 January 1997, SMH 9 June 1996 & SMH 27 June 1997 were exhibited in Bringing the House Down: 12 Months of Australian Political Humour (Canberra: National Museum of Australia/ Old Parliament House exhibition, 1997), cats 6, 30, 35, 59. She was runner-up to Bruce Petty in the 1998 Bringing the House Down for the best cartoon in the exhibition. In the 1999 show she had 4 cartoons hung and one of Howard, Beazley and Meg Lees building sandcastles used on the cover of the catalogue. She was presumably was also in the 2000 show, while her three originals shown in the 2001 Bringing the House Down were: Your street , Queue jumper (2 lifesavers watching drowning swimmer, with one saying: “Better leave 'em. Could be a queue jumper”, published Age 31 August 2001) and War and Peace (both illustrated NMA website).
Several Wilcox cartoons were included in both 1999 b/w art exhibitions curated by Joan Kerr, Craig Judd and Jo Holder at S.H. Ervin Gallery and State Library of New South Wales. “The government will legislate that Australia was uninhabited./ We need that certainty” , published SMH 1 January 1997 (ML PXA 806/2), was in the 'Land’ section of the SLNSW exhibition; “I’m single and the child’s a bastard just like his father” (ML PXA 806/8), published SMH 1997, was in 'Women’; and Australian Police Joke (ML PXA 806/9), published SMH 14 October 1997, was in 'Crime’. Then one day, much to nearly everyone’s surprise, the High Court, by a majority of 4 to 3, ruled that politicians were, as it turned out, unconstitutional , published SMH 12 August 1997, was included in the SHE exhibition (ill. Kerr). 10 originals, including all the above, were purchased from the artist by the SLNSW in January 1999: see PICMAN. Wilcox spoke in a panel discussion on 'the great (neglected) tradition’ at SHE on 21 February 1999 with Joan Kerr and Patrick Cook . She was one of the 9 artists included in the Bunker Gallery’s women cartoonists’ exhibition in 2002-3. Her originals included Dag Pride March ('Men Who Wear Sandals With Socks’, 'Old Ladies With Shopping Trolleys’, 'Boys Without Attitude’, 'Women Who Dress For Comfort’, 'Stamp Collector’, 'Mugaccini Drinkers’, etc) and a gag about executive payouts (both ill. in catalogue).

Fred Williams,"
Frederick Ronald Williams was born in the inner Melbourne suburb of Richmond on 23 January 1927. On leaving school he was apprenticed to a company fitting out shops and making boxes.In later years when he was trying to establish himself in London, he would support himself by making picture frames.At the age of 16 he began classes at the National Gallery School, including painting under William Dargie. He also took painting classes with the gently modernist painter, George Bell.In 1950 he left Australia to further his studies in London. He furthered his studies at the Chelsea Art School, and also studied etching at the Central School of Arts and Crafts. His subject matter from these years was often figurative, as he drew elements of London life and music hall performers, almost in the tradition of Sickert usually on a small scale. He absorbed as much as he could from the great collections of European art, and from the start was especially influenced by the work of Cézanne.These were years of considerable poverty for him, but he wanted to absorb as much knowledge about art as he could.  Patrick McCaughey wrote that bq). He would allow himself a trifling sum, say half a crown, for dinner but would frequently pass it up for an extra pint or two at the pub where Francis Bacon and his crew regularly drank.bq). In 1956 his family were able to arrange a cheap passage home on one of the ships taking visitors to the Melbourne Olympics. Back in Melbourne he saw afresh both the landscape and the collections of the National Gallery of Victoria. These were both intellectually rigorous and emotionally responsive works. His understanding of the value of imagery meant that he was a surprise omission from Bernard Smith’s polemical Antipodean exhibition – especially as it otherwise included all his closest colleagues. But Smith rejected Williams’ essentially apolitical vision. Although he had an exhibiting profile, Fred Williams was less than financially successful until after 1960. That was the year he met Lyn Watson, who was to become his wife. He also changed dealers from Australian Galleries, to the entrepreneurial Rudy Komon, who was able to effectively market his work to the new breed of corporate collectors.In 1963 the Williams family moved to Upwey in the Dandenongs, which became the subject of some of his most iconic works. He flattened the space of the scrubby bush so that it could be read in different ways. The subjects for his graphic work now included his three daughters,drawn on an intimate scale. The following year he was awarded a Helena Rubenstein Travelling Scholarship and the family travelled to Europe. On the return to Upwey Williams continued to paint the landscape around his home. There was a changed response in 1968 when bushfires threatened the house, but then he was also able to make works based on the rebirth of the land. Eight years later, he was flying to China and saw from the plane the lines of bushfires crossing the land. The drawings based on these were mingled with a new appreciation of Chinese aesthetic values.In 1969 the family moved to a house in Hawthorn which remained his home. The 1970s saw more experimental approaches to his art. He returned to painting figures,  including some of the subjects from his London years. 1977 Williams was the first Australian artist to have a solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.In 1979, on his return to Australia, Williams  painted in far north Queensland, and later was encouraged by Sir Roderick Carnegie CRA to paint in the the Pilbara region in Western Australia. These brilliantly coloured gouaches and oil paintings were his last sustained body of work. In 1981 Willams was diagnosed with inoperable cancer, and died on 22 April 1982. At Williams’ funeral his friend John Brack said: bq). The work speaks to usnow, in his voice, as it will speak to those yet to come.bq).

Regina Pilawuk Wilson,"
Regina Wilson was born in 1948 at Wudikapildyerr, in the Daly River region of the Northern Territory.Together with her husband, Harold Wilson, Regina founded the Peppimenarti (meaning 'large rock’) Community as a permanent settlement for the Ngangikurrungurr people in the Daly River region, south-west of Darwin in 1973. The location of the community is an important dreaming site for the Ngangikurrungurr language group and is situated amid wetlands and floodplains at the centre of the Daly River Aboriginal Reserve, 250 kilometres south-west of Darwin.The subject matter of Regina’s works is based around the practice of weaving fibre art, and stems directly from her skills as a master weaver. After attending the Contemporary Art Biennale (Pacific Arts Festival) in 2000, Wilson decided to try acrylic painting.
Regina experimented with various techniques and designs during art workshops in 2001, orchestrated by Darwin gallerist Karen Brown. During this time, she started to transfer her weaving designs and patterns onto the canvas, including syaw (fish-nets), wupun (basket), dilly string bags, wall mats and sun mats.
Wilson won the General Painting category of the Telstra National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award in 2003 for a golden syaw painting.Wilson also celebrates the cultural significance of message sticks – a traditional form of communication between communities – in her paintings and transposes their densely textured qualities onto the canvas.
This is her story of the message stick (with assistance by Peppimenarti resident Captain Wodij):
When we were young we used to live at Daly River and his mob used to live at Uban, near Timber Creek.There was no road, no anything.They used to carry message sticksThey used to come to Daly River from Uban.For weeks they used to travel.They carried message sticks to remember how many days they travel to that certain place.It was like first Aboriginal education. Just to remember how many days to travel from a certain place to Daly.They used to travel from here to Beswick too.Even in flood waters.They used to swim creeks and rivers to get to a place for ceremony.This was before WWII.They were really young men. I remember they used to come.When the war started they moved back to Uban.They used to walk long way, no motor car.They used to join up at Moyle River to fight different clans.They used to swim in the sea, no boat and less crocodiles.Also by bringing the message stick they would bring people back with them. They would all walk together, sometimes for one year. Sometimes stay in one place for camp: big mob food, turtle, yam, fish.They would walk slowly, those old people.And children too, and babies. They’d have the babies half way. We used to have bush nurses who would cut the cord with a mussel shell.They used to take message stick to boss man of a language group. If Boss says yes, they’d all move.If a mob went to another country for burning grass, the leader would get angry and a message stick would follow. Then there would be war.If a man went off with message stick and didn’t return, they think big trouble. A different clan would go and steal another man’s wife.Message stick is for war and ceremony and things like that.That message stick means a lot.
The subject of durrmu (body painting dot) is also explored by Regina.Regina has produced silk screen prints (2002 and 2008) and etchings (2008) with Red Hand and Basil Hall Editions. Examples of Regina’s work are held in the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Queensland Art Gallery, National Gallery of Victoria, the Colin and Elizabeth Laverty collection, The Kaplan-Levi Collection and many other significant corporate and private collections.
Regina has been represented by Karen Brown Gallery (2001-04), Agathon Gallery (2005-06) and Caruana Reid (2008). Her work has been included in many group exhibitions at public and private art institutions, including the Wynne Prize, Art Gallery of New South Wales (2008) and 'Dreaming their Way: Australian Aboriginal Women Painters’ at the National Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington DC (2006).Regina was instrumental in establishing the art centre Durrmu Arts at Peppimenarti in 2007. She lives at Peppimenarti with her three sons, three daughters, two sisters (artists Mabel Jimarin and Margaret Kundu) and her many grandchildren.

John Wolseley,"
John Wolseley was born in Great Britain in 1938. He studied at the Byam Shaw and St. Martin’s School of Art in London, which is widely regarded as one of the world’s leading arts and design institutions. In 1959 he lived in Paris and worked at Atelier 17 with S.W. Hayter, who was a highly influential printmaker of the twentieth century. After working at the Birgit Skiolds print workshop in London in 1962, he later moved to the west of England and founded Nettlecombe Studios, a collective for artists and farmers based at his ancestral home. Following six months in the Spanish Pyrenees and an expedition up the Skrang River, Borneo in the years 1974-75, John Wolseley settled in Australia in 1976. His new home provided him with a distinctive environment removed from the European landscape tradition, shifting his perspective and altering his painting practice when it comes to the intense observation of nature. Since his arrival, Wolseley has made several journeys throughout Australia, beginning in 1980 with his extensive exploration of central Australia, followed in 1984 by a trip to the country’s north-west. In 1991, he was awarded an Australia Council Fellowship which enabled him to spend eight months in the Simpson Desert charting the sand dunes. 
Through various later projects, Wolseley continued to assume the role of an explorer in seeking new locations and embarking upon the study of landscapes and threatened ecosystems. In 1994-95 he spent four months in Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego charting Gondwana, the name given to the ancient continent that included most of the landmasses in today’s Southern Hemisphere. In 1999 he engaged in extensive travel and painting in northern Australia and Indonesia. Furthermore, in 2002 he participated in a four month project in the Royal National Park in New South Wales. By repeatedly immersing himself in new locations, Wolseley finds new ways of relating to the land, which translates into interesting artistic practices. Wolseley documents his explorations through drawings of the intimate processes and natural histories of the sites he visits. His distinctive methods include rubbing paper against burnt tree branches and releasing papers into the wind, which he collects several months later to review the way in which nature has inscribed the works. Mallee (northwest of Melbourne) has been a site of interest for Wolseley in the ten years from 2003 and in 2011 he published a book Lines for Birds, in collaboration with the poet Barry Hill, after they had travelled together across rural Victoria, South East Asia, Japan and France. Most recently, Wolseley is a participating artist in the 18th Biennale of Sydney, 2012. 
Since his work was first exhibited at the London Group in 1959, followed by the Royal Academy in 1960, Wolseley’s work has appeared in a long list of solo and group exhibitions. Selected examples of solo exhibitions include Patagonia to Tasmania: Origin Movement Species Tracing the Southern Continents, Ian Potter Museum of Art, Melbourne, Australia (1996), Bird on a Wire, Roslyn Oxley9 Gallery, Sydney, Australia (2007) and Carboniferous, Roslyn Oxley9 Gallery, Sydney, Australia (2011). His series Tracing the Wallace Line was exhibited at Bendigo Art Gallery in 2001 in an installation that transformed the exhibition space into a model of the Earth’s dynamic system around the Wallace Line. Turning to group exhibitions, Wolseley’s work appeared in The Ecologies Project, Monash University Museum of Art, Melbourne, Australia (2008), Tract: James Geurts, Dominic Redfern, Philip Samartzis, John Wolseley, Margaret Lawrence Gallery, Victorian College of the Arts, Melbourne, Australia (2010) and overseas in Out of Australia: Prints and Drawings from Sidney Nolan to Rover Thomas, British Museum, London, England (2011). 
John Wolseley has received multiple honours in the Trustees of Art Gallery of NSW Watercolour Prize (in 2004, 1996, 1988, 1985 and 1982), as well as several awards, such as the Visual Arts Board Emeritus Award, Australia Council (2005), Kedumba Art Award (1992) and the Mobil Print Award, Australian Print Workshop (1992), of which he was the inaugural recipient. Additionally, in 2005, Wolseley received an Honorary degree from Macquarie University, Sydney, in the course of Doctor of Science, reflecting his knowledge of natural history, botany and ornithology. 
His work is represented in many prominent Australian and British collections including the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra, National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney, Art Gallery of South Australia, Adelaide, Art Gallery of Western Australia, Perth, Arts Council of Great Britain, Contemporary Arts Society, London, Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery, Launceston and Hereford Museum and Art Gallery, Hereford.
