Paintings by George Lambert and John Longstaff were disqualified, as both artists had residences in London, which didn’t fit the criteria that the artist be ‘resident in Australasia’ during the 12 months before the competition closed."

Like the previous year, the now four-time winner WB McInnes was awarded the prize for a portrait of a woman, and again criticism arose about the sitter, Gladys Neville Collins, who was described as ‘the daughter of the senior draughtsman of the Victorian State Parliament’. An article in the West Australian newspaper stated: ‘A portrait of Tom, Dick or Mary Ann is less valuable to Australia than a portrait of a person who has given distinguished service to national life. Although painted with equal skill, it may fairly be declared of less artistic value.’"

Harry McClelland was born in 1884 and is part of a group of Australian artists known as the ‘Gum Tree School’ whose members painted the Victorian countryside and coast. McClelland and his sister Annie May McClelland moved to Long Island, Frankston, in 1912. By the 1920s, the siblings had developed friendships with other creative Victorian identities including Sir Daryl Lindsay and W.B. McInnes. McClelland was the subject of W.B.

Some criticised the subject – a down-on-his-luck young man in worker’s clothes – as not being ‘distinguished’. However, Hanke’s story captured the public interest and audiences were larger than for any previous Archibald Prize exhibition.
A little-known artist, aged just 33, Hanke struggled to survive and support his family during the Great Depression, with his only source of income a series of odd jobs and the government welfare program known as ‘sustenance relief’. For his Archibald painting, he ground his own pigments, re-used a donated frame and, unable to afford a model, looked in the mirror. The portrait took just eight hours to complete.
Hanke’s pluckiness and perseverance in winning the Archibald offered a story of hope for many Australians during the Depression. The portrait went on a celebratory national tour, with people flocking to locations around the country to catch a glimpse of the work."

Her win provoked more press comment than any previous award, with some calling for a government inquiry into the judging of the prize. Part of the reason was, again, due to the appropriateness of the sitter; in this case, Madame Elink Schuurman, wife of the consul-general for the Netherlands.
As the first woman to win the prize, there was a lot of interest in Heysen’s work and life. It emerged in the press coverage that she had been in her kitchen when told of her win; consequently she was also, apparently, the first Archibald winner to have been approached to supply their favourite recipes for The Australian Women’s Weekly (4 February 1939, p4). Her favourites? Hungarian goulash, duck with olive sauce and Chilean stuffed green peppers.
Artist Max Meldrum’s controversial public stance pillorying Heysen’s success was unyielding. He declared, ‘If I were a woman, I would certainly prefer raising a healthy family to a career in art’."

A fellow entrant challenged Dargie’s eligibility on grounds of residency, because he’d been serving overseas for up to six months during the previous 12 months, but the Gallery ruled that this did not contravene the conditions of entry.
Although this did not strictly follow the competition’s rules, the painting was awarded the Archibald Prize, as the wartime circumstances of both artist and sitter were seen as nationally important and the portrait itself was a popular choice."

The unusual style of the painting, described by some as a ‘caricature’, drew record crowds to the Gallery, with opening hours and the exhibition period both extended to meet visitor demand.
The Mirror newspaper reported that some trustees were considering resigning over the award decision. Two entrants, Mary Edwell-Burke (also known as Mary Edwards) and Joseph Wolinski, took legal action against Dobell and the trustees on the grounds that the work was not a portrait as defined by the Archibald bequest.

It’s his second Archibald win, again for a self-portrait.
Critics were divided by this brutally honest self-portrait by Whiteley. The elongated image in the centre references the infamous debate over William Dobell’s Archibald-winning portrait of Joshua Smith of 1943. It is flanked on one side by a baboon howling with anguish as a ghostly hand delivers it a syringe (a reference to Whiteley’s heroin addiction), and on the other by a photograph of Whiteley."

After Eric Smith was awarded the Archibald for his painting of Rudy Komon, John Bloomfield (who’d been stripped of the 1975 prize after his work was ruled ineligible) took legal action.

Flugelman with Wingman was then-64-year-old Warren’s first Archibald entry, and winning the prize allowed him to paint full time. The motif of a ‘wingman’ was inspired by hang-gliders he observed in the country, and the myth of Icarus who flew too close to the sun, melting his feather-and-wax wings. Warren explained, ‘It’s about taking risks, taking chances, and escaping’."

This Archibald Prize-winning painting by Francis Giacco, a homage to cellist John Reichard, attracted controversy due to the incidental placing of the portrait subject. There was precedent for this, however: Brett Whiteley’s face in his 1976 Archibald winner Self-portrait in the studio is similarly tangential to the composition.
