BiographyHistory

×Bio changes summary
Close

Ian Abdulla's mother, Jemima Hunter, was from Raukkan (Port McLeay) and his father was an Afghan man from Hawker in the Flinders Ranges. He and his twin brother Rodney were born under a tree on the banks of the lower River Murray at Swan Reach Mission in 1947. 
In 1961, Abdullah's family moved to Gerard Aboriginal Community. He worked in the rural industry: picking grapes, monitoring irrigation and driving machinery. Abdullah's experience with Christianity during his childhood and adult life is reflected in some of his artwork. Examples of his art work are held in many private and public collections and are also the subject of the book Ian W. Abdulla : Elvis has left the Building (2003).

Abstract
The Murray River of the 1950s was full of fish, and its surrounding landscape covered with vineyards and orchards. As a young boy Ian ranged along its banks and backwaters, catching yabbies, hunting swans and camping along the creeks at night while fishing for pondi, or cod.
But if tucker was plentiful, money was not, for there were few employment opportunities for Aboriginal people.

(p. 8-12)






Abstract
Sheahan-Bright explores '...the growth in publishing by Indigenous writers and publishers, and of writing on Indigenous cultural themes, and some of the issues which confront publishers when dealing with Indigenous writers and illustrators' (8). The article begins with some background, and points out that despite a cultural and artistic heritage that dates back thousands of years, Indigenous writing and publishing has not been widely recognised in mainstream Australian until most recently and Sheahan-Bright says ""This is despite their having been engaged in colonial conflict and later subject to the...assimilation policies which discouraged involvement with European notions of literacy"" (8). She discusses the origins of the Indigenous publishing houses Aboriginal Studies Press (ASP), Institute of Aboriginal Development (IAD Press), Magabala Books, Keeaira Press, Black Ink Press, Indij Readers and briefly refers to the above mentioned texts in the section entitled 'what's being published'. This leads into a summary of the five main issues in relation to Indigenous publishing and the 'need for authenticity in writing about Indigenous peoples and culture' (11). Sheahan-Bright lists these issues as 'respect for country and Indigenous control of material', relevance of copyright issues, lack of understanding from non-Indigenous Australians, the need to consider 'protocol, specific authority, appropriation' and finally, to develop an awareness of the social factors that contribute to the socially and economically disadvantaged position of the majority of Indigenous Australians. She argues that 'knowledge of Indigenous culture is a genuine part of Australian culture ...and the publishing output should reflect that' (12). However, she concludes that while 'there has been growth in publishing Indigenous voices in English', in general, 'there are many miles still to be travelled and many seeds still to be sown' (12)

Thelma Afford was born Thelma Thomas, the only daughter of Mr and Mrs W.J. Thomas, in Broken Hill.She was educated in Adelaide and was one of the first five teachers to introduce art into Adelaide's secondary schools. As well as teaching, she acted in radio plays for the Australian Broadcasting Commission and for the experimental Ab-Intra Studio Theatre, and later became well-known for her costume designs, including those for South Australia's 1936 Centenary Pageant. She lived in Sydney from 1937, marrying playwright Max Afford in 1938. In the years after her husband's death in 1954 she returned to teaching for another eighteen years, then undertook research on the history of the pioneering little theatres of Adelaide. When this failed to be accepted for publication she deposited a copy of 'Adelaide's Little Theatres - Their Dreamers and Visionaries 1900-1940s' in the Fryer Library of the University of Queensland.

Abstract
'Between the 1920s and 1940s there was a diverse flowering of amateur theatres in Adelaide which were experimental, inventive and ahead of their time, anticipating later theatre movements. Dreamers and Visionaries explores the rise and fall of these little theatres, reviewing their performances and personalities, and celebrating their outstanding legacy of experimentation. Afford shows how such groups greatly enhanced the South Australian theatre scene, forming the basis of Adelaide's reputation as 'the city of culture' and helping to contribute to the development of the Adelaide Festival of Arts.'

(p. 26-38)






Abstract
'On display for the first time in 2019–20 in State Library Victoria’s Victoria Gallery is the only surviving costume commissioned by the International Club of Victoria for the Pageant of Nations performed in 1934 and 1935 to celebrate Victoria’s centenary. The costume designed for the pageant’s protagonist, ‘Victoria’, was donated to State Library Victoria in 1998 by Jessie Clarke (nee Brookes),1 who played that role on the stage of Melbourne’s Town Hall for the three performances in 1934, and two additional enactments in 1935. Clarke also donated a hand-coloured studio portrait of herself wearing the costume (shown on page 28). The dynamic ensemble included a hand-painted hooped skirt and a shimmering silver bodice over which trailed a long green cloak veined with silver markings. The entire ensemble was crowned with a striking metallic headdress. State Library Victoria had no record of the identity of the costume’s designer until my own research into realia, manuscripts and pictures in the collection in 2013 led me to discover the story of a woman with talent and ingenuity who contributed an enduring legacy to Australia’s performing arts. This article adds to the previous La Trobe Journal article about the Jessie Clarke costume' (Introduction)

Abstract
'Between the 1920s and 1940s there was a diverse flowering of amateur theatres in Adelaide which were experimental, inventive and ahead of their time, anticipating later theatre movements. Dreamers and Visionaries explores the rise and fall of these little theatres, reviewing their performances and personalities, and celebrating their outstanding legacy of experimentation. Afford shows how such groups greatly enhanced the South Australian theatre scene, forming the basis of Adelaide's reputation as 'the city of culture' and helping to contribute to the development of the Adelaide Festival of Arts.' (Publisher's blurb)

'Aboriginal artist Vernon Ah Kee is a member of the Kuku Yalandji, Waanji, Yidinji and Gugu Yimithirr peoples. His multi-faceted practice includes works that range from large-scale drawings of his ancestors to hard-hitting text-based works and installations. Through clever puns and plays on words and objects Ah Kee fuses the history and language of colonisation with contemporary black/white political issues to expose degrees of underlying racism in Australian society.'

Abstract
'After the riots at Cronulla, I wrote about the separation of that event as a one-off in popular imaginings, while others were riotous flashpoints. The tricky manoeuvres of whiteness include its capacity to produce cultures of racialisation that demonise some, while exonerating the riotous behaviours of others. Aboriginal commentaries on the events at Cronulla were scarce, at that time. Since then, Aboriginal artists have provided commentary on the Cronulla riot as part of a wider critique of whiteness and racialisation in Australia. Fiona Foley’s series of photographs titled ‘Nulla 4 Eva’ infuse Aboriginal, Middle Eastern and Asian ethnicities onto the canvas of Cronulla’s whiteness. Vernon Ah Kee’s Cantchant series also provides commentary on the riots. These Aboriginal artists recall that racialised extremism is not a recent or one-off phenomenon in neocolonial Australia, while Sandra Hill’s Homemaker #6: Surfs Up asks who owns the beach? These artworks provide a reminder of the uneasy relationships between the identifications of Aboriginality and the groups that have arrived since invasion. Cronulla ‘ten years on’ was a time to reflect by including some of the understandings and commentaries of those with the longest memories of racialisation and processual whiteness, in Australia.'

Abstract
'Howard Arkley (1951–99), one of the significant Melbourne artists who came to prominence in the 1970s, has become particularly well known, especially posthumously, for his vivid suburban house imagery. In fact, he explored a much wider variety of themes and styles during a 25-year career that developed from late modernist abstraction to stylised furniture installations, psychedelic- and drug-inspired imagery, urban subjects and portraits. These various subjects (and others) were obviously based on Arkley’s everyday and imaginative life but also drew on his extensive studio collection of references, source material, notes and drawings, the bulk of them now available publicly in State Library Victoria as the Howard Arkley Archive.1 Some of this material has been published and analysed previously. Arkley himself foregrounded his use of source material and working drawings several times, most explicitly in his Casual works exhibition, shown in Melbourne and Brisbane in 1988. After his death, privileged access to his library and other studio material was crucial to my own accounts of his art and working methods, and further research was carried out for the 2015–16 exhibition Howard Arkley and friends, curated by Anthony Fitzpatrick and Victoria Lynn. Despite these studies, though, much of the material in the archive remains unexamined.' (Introduction)

Abstract
'Funny, fast and furry - the WOODLIES are kobolds (small troll-like creatures) that are nuttier than a squirrel's lunch, on a mission to protect their forest from Uglies (the Woodlies call all humans Uglies) and get their paws on the greatest stash of food they can find!
'Big job when you're not much bigger than a squirrel ...
'Fearless FIREHEAD, gentle SEVENPOINTS and Curious NINEEYES are a mischievous crew with two rules. Rule number one? Never be seen by Uglies. Rule number 2? Never be seen by Uglies while stealing their food or sabotaging their weird Ugly plans.
'But when streetwise MIA and her nature-loving dad WELLIE take over a run-down campsite nearby, they bring with them disasters in the form of clumsy campers, greedy developers and a mean cat with a real taste for Woodlies!
'Think that's bad? A gang of renegade Woodlies known as the SWAMP RATS, led by WHITETAIL and his obnoxious cronies - FOULTOE and GNARLYBUTT, are determined to take over the forest and all the food in it. And they're not about to let a bunch of do-gooder Tree Saps get in their way ...
'As if that's not enough, nature itself serves up a menu of freezing blizzards, searing droughts and loads of creatures ready to make the Woodlies their next main course!
'So when NineEyes breaks the number one rule and becomes friends with Mia, it seems like things couldn't get any worse. Is this the end for the Woodlies?
'One thing's for sure... life's about to get a whole lot more interesting!'Source: Flying Bark Productions (http://www.flyingbark.com.au/?portfolio=the-woodlies). Sighted: 12/4/2012

Abstract
While on an archaeological expedition with their parents, Josh and Ling, exploring beneath the temple, find a golden Chinese dragon. Two thousand years earlier, the dragon lent his pearl to the emperor, to help defend the kingdom. But the pearl was buried with the emperor and, without it, the dragon remains entombed. Josh and Ling hope to dig up the pearl and free the dragon, but there are others who crave the pearl's power for their own purposes.
The production is a Chinese-Australian co-production. As a treaty co-production, the film is simultaneously considered a fully Chinese film and a fully Australian film.

Abstract
Three students (one Australian, one German, and one Singaporean) become close friends while studying at a Singaporean boarding school. Disappointed by their inevitable separation at the end of the school year, they are delighted when a fortuitous combination of mobile phones, computers, and a thunderstorm transports them bodily into an Internet chatroom and, from there, into each others' houses. The three spend their days moving freely between Australia, Singapore, and Germany.
The program's official website describes it as 'a vibrant, engaging, contemporary comedy-drama aimed at ""tweens"" throughout the world.'

Abstract
Three young girls accidentally stumble on  a tidepool on a secret island; when bathed in moonlight, the tidepool transforms them into mermaids, with great powers over water--but also a tendency to sprout a tail whenever they come into contact with water.The original three mermaids--Emma, Cleo, and Rikki--separate at the end of season two, when the actress playing Emma left the show. In season three, another character, Bella, is added: Bella had become a mermaid in an unrelated incident some years earlier.The mermaids also face various antagonists, ranging from rivals (e.g., the antagonist for season two, Charlotte, who manages to obtain similar powers from the moon pool) to those who wish to exploit the mermaids for their own profit.As with Jonathan M. Shiff's other productions, the program is aimed largely at young teen audiences.

'Seven 15 year-old surfers have been selected from around Australia and overseas to take part in an intensive 12-month residential school program at Blue Water High. At the beachside school they join other pupils in a normal year's academic work as well as receiving special coaching in surfing. At the end of the year, two of the seven will qualify to surf the pro-circuit and win a three-year sponsorship contract. The series is a race into the finals for the wild card, a race to get through the year, and a race to grow up. The seven teens, forced to live, study and train together—at the same time become best friends and greatest competitors.'Source: Australian Television Information Archive. (Sighted: 20/8/2013)

Abstract
After stumbling on a secret super-computer, clumsy pizza delivery boy Scooter transforms himself into Secret Agent X-19, undertaking a double life of international intrigue.The program draws its inspiration from straightforward spy films, such as the James Bond franchise, as well as their parodic counterparts, such as Get Smart, from which Scooter: Secret Agent draws its comedic tone. Simultaneously, the program makes extensive use of both stuntwork (including wire work) and special effects in order to provide Scooter with a a range of science-fiction gadgets.

Abstract
'In England a recently bereaved widow and her two children discover that they've inherited a property in Australia. With some reluctance they head to Australia to claim their inheritance only to discover that the profitable sheep station they've imagined is in fact a rather out of the way wildlife park full of Australian native animals. What's more it has human occupants as well - a distantly related trio of grandchildren who have been bequeathed lifelong rights to live on the property. As well, there's an Australian born Vietnamese animal handler who's somehow the only one who has real expertise in dealing with native Australian animals.'Source: Screen Australia.

Abstract
When fifteen-year-old Katrina moves to Perth to live with her mother, a veterinary scientist at the local zoo, she begins acting oddly. Realising she can 'mind-meld' with Garang, the zoo's ferocious female tiger, she finds her senses of smell, hearing, and sight improving, including her night vision. Upset and bewildered by his sister's odd behaviour, her eleven-year-old brother Jamie teams up with the youngest daughter of the zoo manager to try and solve the mystery. But not everyone's intentions are honorable, as one of the zoo's scientists plans to manipulate the genetic quirk that Kat and the tiger share, hoping to use it to recreate extinct species.

Abstract
Thrown out of a gold Cadillac in a guitar case one night (strongly suggesting that he is the illegitimate child of Elvis Presley, as well as casting Presley in a rather unfortunate light), Li'l Elvis is raised by Grace and Len, fervent Elvis fans who run an outback diner in the small town of Wannapoo. The problems arise when the world's 'nicest billionaire' W.C. Moore decides to turn Wannapoo into a 1950s' theme town called Li'l Memphis. Every day, L'il Elvis and his Truckstoppers play sets that knock the audience dead, but L'il Elvis secretly wishes he could be a normal kid. But if they stop playing, the tourists stop coming, and Moore calls in everyone's outstanding loans ...

Abstract
'Sino-Australian film co-production was founded on a treaty signed in 2007 and implemented in 2008. This article looks at the impetus for Australian and Chinese film-makers to work together and analyses the challenges of Sino-Australia treaty co-production. It addresses the question of why only a few low-profile films have been made after several years. The rewards from the Chinese market remains elusive, but valuable lessons have been learnt. The two case studies examined by this article illustrate Australia’s junior partnership with China.'

Abstract
'Australian film and television production is concentrated in two principal cities, Sydney and Melbourne, and dispersed among the metropolitan centres of Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth and the next rung of cities and regions including the Gold Coast, Canberra, Hobart and Darwin among others. National and international integration is reshaping the relations among, the television programming taking place within, and the production capabilities and infrastructures of these cities. This article considers the national distribution of screen production capabilities and how media design interests in their coordination, development and control of production activity interact with location interests seeking to sustain production work across these cities.'

(p. 33-47)






Abstract
'One option for television drama producers confronted by rising production standards and increasing costs is to become more international in orientation, leading to speculation that national and cultural boundaries may become less important at the higher end of drama series production. Television drama would then become the ‘decontextualised space for universal modes of storytelling’, with lifestyle and reality television formats the more likely vehicles for expressing ‘cultural specificity’. But national and cultural boundaries do matter. The particularities of national television cultures – local policy configurations, historical and cultural influences, technology uptake, the size and wealth of national economies – all impact on the ability of television producers to engage with the global trade in television fiction. This article examines the way in which this global trade internalises and works with national particularities through the sense of a national brand that locates Australian content within a certain value hierarchy. The following discusses three successful examples of internationalised television programming – McLeod's Daughters (2001–2009), Sea Patrol (2007–), and the children's series H2O: Just Add Water (2006–) – that have worked within international perceptions that differentiate Australian content according to perceived cultural sensibilities and national image.'

Abstract
'Clever Crow is an endearing and witty tale that follows the exploits of a hungry and very clever crow. Crow searches in the bush for food but he can find none. It is only when he comes across people preparing for a ceremony that his luck changes. Crow spots a big turtle egg waiting to be cooked, and he cries out, ‘Yummy, food for me!’ But it is not an easy task stealing a turtle egg – even for a clever crow. Crow has to be more clever than he has ever been before! Children will love Bronwyn Bancrofts’s distinctive illustrations, and how the Djambarrpuynu language translation – Yolnu language from North East Arnhem Land – is woven into the design.'  (Publication summary)

Abstract
'Clever Crow is an endearing and witty tale that follows the exploits of a hungry and very clever crow. Crow searches in the bush for food but he can find none. It is only when he comes across people preparing for a ceremony that his luck changes. Crow spots a big turtle egg waiting to be cooked, and he cries out, ‘Yummy, food for me!’ But it is not an easy task stealing a turtle egg – even for a clever crow. Crow has to be more clever than he has ever been before! Children will love Bronwyn Bancrofts’s distinctive illustrations, and how the Djambarrpuynu language translation – Yolnu language from North East Arnhem Land – is woven into the design.'  (Publication summary)

(p. 271-279)






Abstract
'Since Jacqueline Rose published The Case of Peter Pan in 1984, scholars in the field of children's literature have taken up a rhetorical stance which treats child readers as colonised, and children's books as a colonising site. This article takes issue with Rose's rhetoric of colonisation and its deployment by scholars, arguing that it is tainted by logical and ethical flaws. Rather, children's literature can be a site of decolonisation which revisions the hierarchies of value promoted through colonisation and its aftermath by adopting what Bill Ashcroft refers to as tactics of interpolation. To illustrate how decolonising strategies work in children's texts, the article considers several alphabet books by Indigenous author-illustrators from Canada and Australia, arguing that these texts for very young children interpolate colonial discourses by valorising minority languages and by attributing to English words meanings produced within Indigenous cultures.'

Abstract
'Del Kathryn Barton knows what it is to be a child spinning into a dissociative state, the terror that takes on a life of its own. “Especially for the child’s mind,” she says. “I’m sure there’s lots of classifications now. I used to go into states and I still don’t even really know what they were. I really felt that I was not in control of my mind or my senses or my capacity to function in any normal way. Hearing voices and auditory hallucinations. It was horrific.”'(Introduction)

BiographyHistory

×Bio changes summary
Close

Richard Bell,  contemporary artist and activist was born and grew up in Charleville, Queensland. In his 30s he moved to Brisbane,  where he 'started to think of art as a potential career'.Bell described himself as 'an activist masquerading as an artist', being politically influenced by the black power movement and people such as the late Isabel Coe, and Gary Foley.  It was during the time of the lead-up to the 1988 Bi-centenary of white Australian settlement, that Bell challenged 'non-Indigenous artists who appropriated Indigenous imagery in their work and the perceived notions of traditional and modern Indigenous art.' Bell's own work addressed contemporary issues such as religion, art and politics.Source: Koori Mail, issue 551:21

Abstract

'50 years of First Nations activism in Australia through the lens of contemporary Australian Aboriginal artist Richard Bell.
'First Nations artist Richard Bell proclaims himself to be an ‘activist masquerading as an artist.’ His confrontational work and attitudes have stirred the Australian art world while being lauded internationally, taking him from a childhood in a rural Queensland shack to the lofty halls of the Tate Modern. Schooled in the rough and tumble politics of Redfern and the Canberra Tent Embassy, his work challenges the institutions of colonisation in Australia and asserts the rights of First Nations people around the world. Through this collaboration with Emory Douglas, a Black Panther known as the ‘Revolutionary Artist’ Bell’s work links the fight for rights in Australia and the U.S. He has profoundly challenged the Australian art world with his scorching manifesto, Bell’s Theorem, that labelled the Aboriginal Art industry as ‘a white thing’ defined by colonial power structures that profit most from it. At a time when Australia is contemplating voice, truth and treaty, Bell’s ideas cannot be ignored.'

The milieu of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art has been a positive revelation.''Despite the unresolved problems facing indigenous Australia, to my mind Aboriginal art is the rose in the garden. In recent decades its flowering has been the most amazing story in the global art world. From the desert to the cities, it has blossomed in infinite variety. ...'

Artist and illustrator, Jean Bellette 'studied at the Hobart Technical College under Lucien Dechaineux. She was talented, versatile and imaginative, and eager to explore various methods of expressing her artistic passions. In the 1930s she studied at the Julian Ashton School of Art in Sydney, and in 1939, while travelling to study in Europe, she met and married Swiss-born artist and critic Paul Haefliger. They returned to Sydney, where Bellette won the Sulman Prize in 1942 and 1944, but in 1957 moved to Mallorca. They often returned to Sydney, particularly their cottage at Hill End, which is now available for lease as an artist's retreat.'Source: The Companion to Tasmanian History website http://www.utas.edu.au/library/companion_to_tasmanian_history/index.htm (Sighted: 03/08/2011)

BiographyHistory

×Bio changes summary
Close

Mervyn Bishop was Australia's first Indigenous press photographer. Bishop's photography career started in 1954 when he borrowed his mother's camera. In 1962 he was a successful applicant for a cadetship with the Sydney Morning Herald. Bishop also worked as a photographer at the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, photographic assistant and advisor for the National Geographic Society, and taught photography at Tranby College and the Eora Centre.
While he was a cadet with the Sydney Morning Herald, Bishop finished the Photography Certificate Course at Sydney Technical College. He also completed an Associate Diploma of Adult Education (Aboriginal Education) in 1989.
Bishop exhibited his work in the NADOC 1986 Exhibition of Aboriginal and Islander Photographers at the Aboriginal Artists Gallery. Bishop's first solo exhibition was called In Dreams: Mervyn Bishop Thirty Years of Photography 1960-1990 (1991). His solo exhibition then toured Australia and overseas for over a decade. Bishop also participated in the New Images in Australian History exhibition at the University of Sydney's Tin Shed Gallery (1989). His photography was displayed in Images of Black Sport at the Powerhouse Museum, Sydney (1991); Her Story: Images of Domestic Labour in Australian Art at the S. H. Ervin Gallery (1991); Aratjara: Art of the First Australians (1993), and Urban Focus: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art from the Urban Areas of Australia at the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra (1994). 
Bishop's iconic works include the photo of Gough Whitlam pouring red sand into Vincent Lingiari's hand, and the Life and Death Dash - displaying a nun running with a choking child in her arms. The later photograph won him the Press Photographer of the Year (1971).

Abstract
This book was prepared by the compilers, with the permission of Barrett Reid, to bring together poems associated with Reid over a period of more than forty years. It was presented as a 'keepsake to mark his sixtieth birthday' with Reid's one stipulation that nothing be written specifically for the book. In the later stages of preparation some attempt was made to include paintings and drawings associated with Reid although the compilers note that it was 'little more than a token effort.'

BiographyHistory

×Bio changes summary
Close

'Bundjalung-Munajali woman, Euphemia (Phemie) Bostock's mother was born at Nymbodia, outside of Grafton. Her father worked for the Department of Main Roads, so much of her early life was spent travelling through rural New South Wales. When World War II broke out the family settled in Brisbane until the early 1960s. Phemie then moved with her two daughters to Sydney and became involved in the Aboriginal struggle working with various community organizations. She has worked across a variety of media including textile, sculpture and printmaking since the 1960s. Her artistic training took place at the East Sydney Technical College, Sydney College of the Arts, and Redfern's Eora Centre. '
Aunty Phemie is a respected Elder and has exhibited widely in Australia and internationally. Her work has been featured on the Australian Design Stamp Series for Australia Post. She was a founding member of the Boomalli Aboriginal Artists Co-operative. Source: (in part) www.boomalli.org.au/ and www.daao.org.au/ Sighted 23/04/2009).

×Bio changes summary
Close

 
Robin Boyd is best remembered for his award-winning work as an architect, but he was also a talented communicator. While studying architecture in Melbourne he helped establish the Victorian Architectural Students' Society (VASS) and wrote the editorials for its newsletter Smudges. He also used the newsletter to criticise or praise individual Melbourne buildings, a practice which attracted at least one threat of legal action. 
In 1946, after service in PNG during WWII, he became the director of the Small Homes Service, which was set up by the Royal Victorian Institute of Architects in conjunction with Melbourne newspaper, the Age. The service opened in July 1947 and was dedicated to promoting rational house-design. Boyd's intensive involvement included writing weekly articles for the Age which made his ideas on house design widely-known. He continued to write and lecture part-time, wrote for the Sydney Morning Herald, and published Victorian Modern (1947), Australia's Home (1952) and The Australian Ugliness (1960).
In 1956-57 he was Fulbright scholar and visiting professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He gained an international reputation and continued to publish works of architectural theory, wrote scripts for broadcast commentaries and wrote regular articles for the Sunday edition of the Australian. Boyd won numerous awards, including the Royal Australian Institute of Architects gold medal in 1969 and appointment as C. B. E. in 1971. Boyd is known for both his ideas on design and his social comment. 
His last work, Great Great Australian Dream, published in 1972 after his death, summed up his views on his profession and the issues facing his generation. Following his sudden death in 1971 the R. A. I. A. read excerpts from his writings in a public tribute.

2018;








Abstract
'Biblical literacy is likely lower in Australia today than at any point since the convict era. General levels of familiarity with the Christian scriptures are difficult to plot precisely, but studies of Bible reading habits, and data on various forms of Christian socialisation, indicate a significant decline in Australians’ exposure to the Bible over the last half century.'  (Introduction)

Abstract
'A viewing of the impressive exhibition of Arthur Boyd's works mounted by the National Gallery of Australia this spring just past, has combined with a more recent visit to Boyd's house at Bundanon on the Shoalhaven River in New South Wales to prompt some timely reflections on one who was arguably the most significant figure among the Australian artists of the twentieth century.'

single work 


biography 







Abstract
'In 1913 Murrumbeena was a village surrounded by market gardens, paddocks and large private estates. It was also the place where a young, creative and resourceful Merric Boyd came to live and establish a pottery. For almost half a century, he produced some of the finest and most original ceramics made in this country or any other and, with his wife Doris, raised five remarkably talented and artistic children.
'Since 1988 Colin Smith has been recording the recollections of those who knew Merric Boyd and his family. Their stories provide a unique insight into his community and into Murrumbeena's most famous residents - the Boyds.'

single work 


biography 







Abstract
'Arthur Boyd's legacy is a collection of masterpieces that define the history of Australian art in the last century. But the man himself-enigmatic, inarticulate, modest-has remained in the shadows until now.'Based on over six years of meticulous research and hundreds of interviews, Darleen Bungey sweeps us into the intimate circle of one of Australia's most fascinating families. Arthur Boyd emerges as a passionate, dramatic figure whose self-effacing demeanour cloacked a strong personality that refused to allow his turbulent and sometimes tragic personal life to interfere with his creative genius.'From Victoria's bohemian enclaves to the heady swirl of Melbourne and London in the years of artistic and social revolution, to the rural removes of Suffolk and the Shoalhaven, this is a journey into the mind and heart of a complex man whose absolute commitment to his art thrust aside personal adversity in the relentless pursuit of his work.'There are art books and there are biographies. Arthur Boyd: A life is rare - a revelation of an artist's life as compelling as the writing about his art.' (Publication summary)

Geoffrey Dutton 
,
		







St Lucia

University of Queensland Press

,
1994




Z91836

1994



single work 


autobiography 







Abstract
'""I was born in a house of books.""
'So begins this long-awaited autobiography, in which Geoffrey Dutton embarks on an honest, controversial and brilliantly entertaining journey through seventy crowded years.
'His unusual childhood was dominated by the lavish lives of his wealthy parents who collected houses as well as books, although young Geoffrey was despatched to boarding school at a young age while his mother traveled abroad to enjoy a flirtation with the European aristocracy.
'His real education came later, in wartime. I've joined the air force, and as well as embarking on various amorous adventures, his risky low flying antics had him promptly locked up in the ""boob"".
'During the war he also began publishing poetry and was closely associated with the modernist movement in art and literature. Later I studied at Magdalen College, Oxford, where CS Lewis was one of his tutors.
'Since then Geoffrey Dutton has become renowned as a poet, critic, biographer, publisher and editor. In this masterpiece of literary autobiography he traces many journeys, from his sojourn in Cold War crazy Kansas to a wild and wonderful visit to Russia as a hapless victim of Intourist. Other travels take him through the Pacific, Africa, Europe and the Mediterranean.
'There are many intimate portraits of his sometimes volatile friends, among them the feisty Zhenya Yevtushenko, fellow flier David Campbell, Russell Drysdale, Arthur Boyd, Sidney Nolan, the precocious Robert Hughes, Ken Slessor, and Max Harris, eccentric survivor of ""Ern Malley "" Here too is the full story of the celebrated, quarter-century friendship with Patrick White which ended so bitterly.'

Guy Boyd was one of Australia's foremost figurative sculptors, a potter, and a social and environmental activist. Examples of his work are held in the Australian National Gallery and all State galleries as well as collections in regional Australia and overseas. His pioneering designs in post-WWII pottery have become collectors items. He was founder of the Brighton Foreshore Protection Association, President of the Port Phillip Conservation Council and he was arrested in Tasmania during the campaign to save the Franklin River. 
In 1984, he self-published a book entitled Justice in Jeopardy documenting the Lindy Chamberlain case and he campaigned vigorously for her release. As the nephew and literary executor of the writer Martin Boyd, he was responsible for the republication of many of Boyd's novels and for the subsequent revival of interest in Martin Boyd's work. In 1952, he married Phyllis Nairn with whom he had seven children.

Abstract
'This article presents a general explanation of government subsidy to the arts, drawing on the historical experience of Australian alternative theatre from the late 1970s to the early 1990s - a period of expansion for the sector, but not for alternative theatre. It describes the strategic categories of measurement used by the country's major cultural provision agency at the time, the Australia Council, and presents an eightpart model showing how natural language terms - 'excellent', 'innovative', 'experimental', 'accessible', etc. - were taken up and repositioned as functional operators of capture by the peer assessment process. Using the structural analysis adopted by Ernesto Laclau in the ground-breaking On Populist Reason (2005), most especially his theory of the 'empty signifier' and its role in organising 'equivalential chains', or broad-based alliances of social demand, it suggests how Australian theatre was fractured, fragmented and recuperated by the competitive grant system. 'Difference', an effect of creative activity, was expropriated as the mark of its value, a saleable symbol in a world of increasingly symbolic commodities. With the consolidation of the Australia Council's dominance over the theatre sector during the period, difference could be fed back as market difference with the government as a 'corporate regulator'. While the rebarbative rhetoric of alternative artists might have remained the same, a creusant in Mallarme's sense had taken place, a hollowing-out - and a return to the values that so many of them were trying to rebel against.'

Abstract
'Urban terrorist Ray Unit (Michael Callaghan) plants a smoke bomb at the Martin Place cenotaph in Sydney on Anzac Day. Travelling in disguise, Ray visits his mother, Elsie (Joy Burns), and family in suburban Perth. He discusses the predatory nature of photography with Paula (Sandy Edwards) at Cottesloe Beach before heading to rural Western Australia. Spending time among sheep farmers and wheat growers, Ray applies for political asylum in Hutt River Province, a self-declared autonomous state run by Prince Leonard (Leonard Casley). Ray’s every move is tracked by electronic surveillance. An unseen voice of authority guides the investigation while delivering instructions to his underlings on the best means of dealing with Ray and the beliefs he holds.'Source: Australian Screen.

'Isabel Coe, a Wiradjuri woman, was born in Cowra, New South Wales, and grew up in the Erambie Mission. She moved to Sydney in the late 1960s. She was one of the Aboriginal activists involved in setting up the Aboriginal Tent Embassy in January 1972, along with her husband Billy Craigie, Michael Anderson, Tony Coorey and Bertie Williams. The four men began the Tent Embassy by planting a beach umbrella on the lawn in front of Parliament House (now Old Parliament House) on 26 January 1972 to protest the then Federal Government's refusal to recognise Aboriginal land rights. The beach umbrella was soon replaced by several tents and supporters came from all parts of Australia to join the protest.' (Source : The Australian Women's Register website)

Abstract
'Australia’s worst modern industrial accident occurred on 15 October 1970, when a 2000-ton span of the West Gate Bridge fell during construction. Thirty-five bridge workers died and a further eighteen were injured. The play The Bridge, written by Vicki Reynolds in 1990, tells the stories of these workers using verbatim techniques and a contemporary narrative in which a family touched by the disaster prepares for a barbeque to mark the anniversary of the collapse. An excerpt of the play is republished here, alongside a discussion between community theatre maker Donna Jackson and artist Bindi Cole Chocka (daughter of Vicki Reynolds), who remounted the play recently for the 2018 Arts & Industry Festival.'  (Introduction)

Abstract
'Is Australia a 'racist' country? Why do issues of race and culture seem to ignite public debate so readily?'Tim Soutphommasane, Australia's Race Discrimination Commissioner, reflects on the national experience of racism and the progress that has been made since the introduction of the Racial Discrimination Act in 1975. As the first federal human rights and discrimination legislation, the Act was a landmark demonstration of Australia's commitment to eliminating racism.'Published to coincide with the Act's fortieth anniversary, this book gives a timely and incisive account of the history of racism, the limits of free speech, the dimensions of bigotry and the role of legislation in our society's response to discrimination.'With contributions by Maxine Beneba Clarke, Bindi Cole Chocka, Benjamin Law, Alice Pung and Christos Tsiolkas.'

Olive Cotton : A Life in Photography





Helen Ennis

16573779

2019



single work 


biography 







Abstract
'A landmark biography of a singular and important Australian photographer, Olive Cotton, by an award-winning writer - beautifully written and deeply moving.
'Olive Cotton was one of Australia's pioneering modernist photographers, a woman whose talent was recognised as equal to her first husband's, Max Dupain, and a significant artist in her own right. Together, Olive and Max could have been Australia's answer to Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, or Ray and Charles Eames. The photographic work they produced during the 1930s and '40s was extraordinary and distinctively their own.
'But in the early 1940s Cotton quit their marriage and Sydney studio to live with second husband Ross McInerney and raise their two children in a tent on a farm near Cowra - later moving to a hut that had no running water, electricity or telephone. Despite these barriers, and not having access to a darkroom, Olive continued her photography but away from the public eye. Then a landmark exhibition in Sydney in 1985 shot her back to fame, followed by a major retrospective at the AGNSW in 2000. Australian photography would never be same.
'This is a moving and powerful story about talent, creativity and women, and about what it means for an artist to manage the competing demands of art, work, marriage, children and family.'

Indigenous story 







Abstract
'Gurindji country is located in the southern Victoria River in the Northern Territory of Australia. Gurindji people became well known in the 1960s and 1970s due to their influence on Australian politics and the Indigenous land rights movement. They were instrumental in gaining equal wages for Aboriginal cattle station employees and they were also the first Aboriginal group to recover control of their traditional lands. In Karu, Gurindji women describe their child-rearing practices. Some have a spiritual basis, while others are highly practical in nature, such as the use of bush medicines. Many Gurindji ways of raising children contrast with non-Indigenous practices because they are deeply embedded in an understanding of country and family connections. This book celebrates children growing up Gurindji and honours those Gurindji mothers, grandmothers, assistant teachers and health workers who dedicate their lives to making that possible.  (Publication summary)

Abstract
'The Gurindji people of the Northern Territory are perhaps best-known for their walk-off of Wave Hill Station in 1966, protesting against mistreatment by the station managers. The strike would become the first major victory of the Indigenous land rights movement. Many discussions of station life are focused on the harsh treatment of Aboriginal workers.

'Songs from the Stations portrays another side of life on Wave Hill Station. Amongst the harsh conditions and decades of mistreatment, an eclectic ceremonial life flourished during the first half of the 20th century. Constant travel between cattle stations by Indigenous workers across north-western and central Australia meant that Wave Hill Station became a cross-road of desert and Top End musical styles. As a result, the Gurindji people learnt songs from the Mudburra who came further east, the Bilinarra from the north, the Nyininy from the west, and the Warlpiri from the south.

'This book is the first detailed documentation of wajarra, public songs performed by the Gurindji people in response to contemporary events in their community. Featuring five song sets known as Laka, Mintiwarra, Kamul, Juntara, and Freedom Day, it is an exploration of the cultural exchange between Indigenous communities that was fostered by their involvement in the pastoral industry.' (Publication summary)

Abstract
'In a time before radio or even gramophones, songs were shared between Aboriginal groups at large social gatherings. Some songs were so popular they spread enormous distances.
'One such song known as Wanji-wanji has travelled some thousands of kilometres. Incredibly, the lyrics have remained unchanged over this distance and the past 150 years it has been sung.' (Introduction)

Abstract
'When 19-year-old wunderkind journalist Erik Jensen (now editor of The Saturday Paper) was invited by bad-boy Australian painter Adam Cullen to write his biography, Jensen (Toby Wallace, Romper Stomper) jumped at the chance. Despite a turbulent relationship, the two formed a unique bond that lasted until Cullen’s death in 2012 aged just 46.'

Abstract
'An unflinching portrait of talent and addiction.'In 2008 the artist Adam Cullen invited journalist Erik Jensen to stay in his spare room and write his biography.'What followed were four years of intense honesty and a relationship that became increasingly claustrophobic. At one point Cullen shot Jensen, in part to see how committed he was to the book. At another, he threw Jensen from a speeding motorbike. The book contract Cullen used to convince Jensen to stay with him never existed.'Acute Misfortune is a riveting account of the life and death of one of Australia's most celebrated artists, the man behind the Archibald Prize-winning portrait of David Wenham. Jensen follows Cullen through drug deals and periods of deep self-reflection, onwards into his court appearance for weapons possession and finally his death in 2012 at the age of forty-six. The story is by turns tender and horrifying: a spare tale of art, sex, drugs and childhood, told at close quarters and without judgement.' (Publication summary)

(p. 66-69)






Abstract
'Shaping the globally‑inflected histories of today are endless encounters between worlds. They can be seen across Australia in the exchanges between Aboriginal and settler groups and they paint myriad stories of who we are - some told, many untold. These cross‑cultural collisions are striking motifs for artists and storytellers, running like veins through our collective body, further amplified as the last generation of pre- and first‑contact Aboriginal people pass away. Not only is there a mutual desire to express and to hear these stories but there is an urgency to archive them for the world.' (Publication abstract)

Abstract
'There are many beautiful buildings on North Terrace, Adelaide, home to the edifices of stone where the activities of colonial government were once performed. In the single long block resides the State Library, the museum, the art gallery and two university campuses; the tightest grouping of cultural institutions I have seen. North Terrace projects a magnetism, a gravity.'  (Introduction)

Abstract
'In one essay, Richard Flanagan describes the phone call that alerted him to the death of wilderness photographer Peter Dombrovskis:
'I was driving to Salamanca through black clouds and heavy-dropped rain that sweeps and slaps rather than falls, while Hobart’s higher suburbs were being coated in snow. The radio news said a solo walker had failed to return from a walking trip to the Western Arthurs. I rang a friend who worked in police search and rescue.'  (Introduction)

Abstract
'At once ad man and artist, designer and entrepreneur, Ken Done has achieved what few others have. His signature style has graced ad campaigns and cars, magazine covers and duvet covers, public spaces and landmark cultural events, but it is his unabated passion for painting that sustains him. For more than forty years, Done has chronicled the Australian way, documenting how it feels to be Australian with an exuberance that is immediately recognisable.
'Ken Done: Art Design Life documents Done’s expansive art and design practice over four decades and provides a fascinating insight into the artist and his oeuvre. The book features both early and lesser-known works, as well as the iconic paintings of Sydney Harbour, the Outback and the reef. It opens an extensive archive, providing readers in-depth access to the catalogue of fashion and homewares, and the designs that came to define an era.'

Ken Done : A Life Coloured In

single work 


autobiography 







Abstract
'An impressionistic and exuberant memoir by Australia's best-loved artist.'Ken Done has an extraordinary place in the hearts of Australians - we've all worn or decorated our homes with his artwork. His vivid, optimistic images are part of our collective consciousness and have helped define us to the world. But what do we know about the man behind the brush?'A dreamy country kid-turned-art student, Ken took off overseas for a Mad Men-esque advertising career before an epiphany at a Matisse exhibition showed him that painting was where his heart truly lay. But a return to Sydney to paint saw his art overtaken by his entrepreneurial instincts as 'Ken Done' became a sought-after global brand.'However there's more to Ken Done's story than just commercial success: the sudden loss of the profits from a lifetime's hard work and a resultant stressful court case was closely followed by a shock cancer diagnosis. It was a dark time, but the powerful paintings that came out of this bleak period have brought him long-overdue acclaim as one of our great artists. From his studio on sparkling Sydney Harbour to the ochre tints of the outback or the luminous palette of tropical waters, Ken's artist's eye is ever drawn to beauty and colour. But through good times and bad, what has sustained him are the simple pleasures of life: family, home and, of course, painting. ' (Publication summary)

Aboriginal Women’s Portraiture : Margaret Olley and Julie Dowling

Abstract
'Portraits of Australian Aboriginal women have historically reflected artistic styles, changing perceptions and the unique characteristics of the individual artist, but it was not until the 1950s that Aboriginal women began to be presented by Australian portraitists in a more humanistic and holistic way. In the 1960s, a shift took place in the way Aboriginal women were portrayed, when the Australian artist Margaret Olley [1923-2011] focused upon Aboriginal women differently. She imaged Aboriginal women in terms of painterly aesthetics, ignoring the societal, racial and historical meanings that could have been symbolically attached to her imagery if she had chosen to do so. This article focuses firstly on Olley’s contribution and its interpretation by the Gamilaroi art historian, Donna Leslie. It then extends the investigation of Aboriginal women's portraiture in contemporary Australian art through the exploration of a select group of paintings by the portraitist Julie Dowling (1969-), of the Badimaya people of Western Australia. This article is written by an Indigenous Australian author.' (Publication abstract)

Abstract
'Probably no swagman, in life or in fiction, ever had such a strange companion on his wanderings as has Macauley, the central character in D'Arcy Niland's first novel, who tramps through the back towns of New South Wales accompanied by his daughter Buster. Buster, four-year-old bundle of loyalty and fortitude, combines these more adult qualities with a natural childishness...Buster is no joy to Macauley, and he treats her with an uncompromising firmness: she must go on walking when she is nearly exhausted, must stop chattering when he wants to be quiet, must not complain. But Macauley has, too, a certain grudging affection for her, and this affection develops until it is so threatened by circumstances that it must at last be openly admitted.'

Abstract
'I am writing in the front room of Murrays Cottage, where Donald Friend made his home for two years, until he left for Europe in March 1949. He visited again from time to time in later years. His friend Donald Murray remained in the cottage until his death in 1988, for Russell Drysdale and Friend had combined to purchase the cottage for him, Friend's stays in Hill End, and the extended stays by artist friends such as Russell Drysdale and Margaret Olley, transformed the almost deserted ex-goldmining town into the artists' colony it remains to this day. According to the local shopkeeper, the population of the town today is 117. In 1872, at the height of the gold rush, the population was anywhere between 10,000 and 30,000, depending on whom you believe.' (Introduction)

biography 







Abstract
'The year 2012 is the centenary of the birth of Russell Drysdale, one of the greatest Australian painters of the twentieth century. This book celebrates his achievement as a draughtsman. Coming into prominence during the 1940s amid the cultural and social changes precipitated by the Second World War, Drysdale initiated a new vision of Australian landscape which replaced the pastoralism of the Heidelberg School. Together with Sidney Nolan, Drysdale transformed Australian painting providing a penetrating view more in line with modern ideas and perceptions. He revealed the vastness, emptiness and dryness of the landscape and its effects on the people who survived in those sparse, arid conditions. Drawing has been vital in Drysdale's career. It was when passing the time drawing while in hospital that his talent was noticed, which led to him studying at the Bell School and putting down the foundation for his future life as a painter. Drysdale is known for a series of highly imaginative and wonderful paintings such as The Drover's Wife, The Cricketers, West Wyalong and some exceptional paintings of Aboriginal figures, but he was also a prolific draughtsman, for whom drawing was the basis of all his work. This book covers the entire period of his career; it includes both working drawings, drawings made for their own sake as well as quotations from the artist. It also delves into the nature of drawing itself and the changes that this discipline has undergone during the twentieth century. 
This book is based on an exhibition of Drysdale drawings organised by Lou Klepac in conjunction with Carrick Hill, Adelaide, [South Australia] beginning at S.H. Ervin Gallery in Sydney, [New South Wales] then showing in Carrick Hill followed by Mornington Peninsula Regional gallery in Victoria...' (Trove record)

Abstract
'Max Dupain, one of Australia’s most accomplished photographers, was filled with self-doubt. He told us so – repeatedly – in public commentary, especially during the 1980s, in the last years of his life. It is striking how candid he was, how personal, verging on the confessional, and how little attention we paid to what he said, either during his lifetime or since (he died in 1992, aged eighty-one).'

Paradise is a Place





Gillian Mears 
,
		







Milsons Point


:

Random House

,
1997




Z56687

1997



single work 


autobiography 







Abstract
' Paradise is a Place is an essay in images and words, offering a glimpse into the pleasures of being a child. Sandy Edwards' evocative photographs, taken over eight summers in the mythic landscape of the far south coast of New South Wales - amid spotted gum forests edged by sea - chronicle a young girl's passage from childhood to adolescence. Her luminous and moody portraits emphasise the vulnerability and freedom of childhood.
Novelist Gillian Mears' childhood was characterised by idyllic camps with a Field Naturalists Club on beach and mountain. Here she writes of those years with a camera's eye for detail and nuance, with the honesty and insight that mark all her work. Her essay is a meditation on innocence, memory, the act of seeing, and the particular poignancy of auntly love.' Publisher's blurb on inside of front cover.

Murawina : Australian Women of High Achievement

			(editor),
		


Sandy Edwards 

			(illustrator),
		







Sydney


:

Doubleday

,
1993




Z25575

1993



anthology 


autobiography 







Abstract
'The women come from a range of backgrounds, from isolated and deeply traditional communities to the urban and highly technical, and pursue varied careers and interests.
Many of the stories will shock. From the first-hand experience of these women, it becomes clear that racist attitudes we may have hoped had disappered from the Australian landscape continue to flourish in many quarters. 
Murrawina is a tribute to the vitality, courage and optimism of these women, and to all Australian women'.

Abstract
'Warlpiri is a language of the Tanami Desert area of the Northern Territory of Australia. Hundreds of Warlpiri speakers from the main Warlpiri communities of Yuendumu, Willowra, Lajamanu, Nyirrpi and Alekarenge have contributed to the Warlpiri Dictionary, which has been more than 50 years in the making.
'It contains Warlpiri words with English translations; instructive example sentences rich with Warlpiri history and cultural practices; detailed flora and fauna information; more than 500 illustrations, plus colour photographs; and maps of Warlpiri country. With an English word finder, and a guide to Warlpiri grammar and to the complex vocabulary for family relations this dictionary is essential for both beginner and advanced speakers of Warlpiri, translators and interpreters, and for anyone interested in learning more about Warlpiri language and culture.' (Publication summary)

single work 


film/TV 







Abstract
A 'mock-umentary' about making a documentary, From the Tropics to the Snow sees a scriptwriter and a director argue their approaches to the problem of making a comprehensive documentary about Australia. One favours an experimental style, the other a more conventional approach. Wittily observed excerpts from both proposed films indicate the faults of each, and the problems of making such a film are chronicled with considerable humour.

Abstract
'In the 1950s Charmian Clift and her husband decided to escape the cold and routine of London for the warmth of the Greek island, Kalymnos. Far from the tourist trail, Kalymnos was bare and poor - an escape, but by no means paradise. Yet as the months went by, Clift and her family became part of the community. This book captures the essence of island life.'

Abstract
The Oxford Companion to Australian Literature (1993): 387 comments: 'Class distinctions are made very clear in To See the Queen (1953). Patsy, Cherry, Roger and Christine are from families where wrist-watches, ponies and large properties are the order of the day, while the Fords live in a wretched shack, which they do not seem able to keep tidy. Fortunately, breeding wins through, and the girls soon straighten things up.'

Fiona Foley creates work across media that deal with history, identity, sovereignty and personal signification. In all her work, she insists the viewer re-examine historical stereotypes.
Her national contribution to the arts was recognised when she was awarded the Australia Council artist of the year for 2013.
Throughout her career, Foley has engaged issues of indigenous identity on a regional, national and international level, creating a dialogue with artists and communities here and around the world. In 2013 Foley delivered the keynote address for the Origins Festival of First Nations in London.
In 2009-10, the University of Queensland Art Museum and Sydney’s Museum of Contemporary Art co-curated a major survey exhibition of Fiona Foley’s work, titled Forbidden.
In 2011, Fiona Foley was appointed an Adjunct Professor with the University of Queensland and her essay, ‘When the Circus Came to Town’ was published in the November issue of Art Monthly.
Recent group shows include the Australia exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts, London, and unDisclosed – 2nd National Indigenous Art Triennial.
Recent solo shows include a retrospective at Andrew Baker Gallery as well as a show at CAST in Tasmania and Niagara Galleries. Another show of works from her career was exhibited at Redcliffe City Gallery titled Courage.
She has many major public sculpture works including Lie of the Land, Melbourne (1997); Bible and Bullets, at Redfern Park, Sydney (2008); Black Opium, State Library of Queensland, Brisbane (2009) and Blue Water Art Trail, Mackay (2009).
A founding member of the Boomalli artist co-op formed in 1987, Foley has been involved in numerous group projects over the course of her career and has a deep commitment to mentoring the next generation of contemporary Indigenous artists and arts professionals.
In 2020, she released Biting the Clouds: A Badtjala Perspective on the Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act, 1897 (UQP).

Abstract
Biting The Clouds
A Badtjala perspective on the Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act, 1897
'In this groundbreaking work of Indigenous scholarship, nationally renowned visual artist Fiona Foley addresses the inherent silences, errors and injustices from the perspective of her people, the Badtjala of K’gari (Fraser Island). She shines a critical light on the little-known colonial-era practice of paying Indigenous workers in opium and the ‘solution’ of then displacing them to K’gari.
Biting the Clouds – a euphemism for being stoned on opium – combines historical, personal and cultural imagery to reclaim the Badtjala story from the colonisation narrative. Full-colour images of Foley’s artwork add further impact to this important examination of Australian history.'

Abstract
'In a bold and unprecedented project, acclaimed international artist Fiona Foley curated a cutting edge installation in the University of Queensland's sandstone Great Court. Universities have traditionally been elite institutions, overlooking and undervaluing the knowledge contributions of Indigenous thinkers, activists and artists. This history is etched into the walls of the Great Court, with anachronistic concepts of humanity and racial difference revealed in many of friezes and sculptural reliefs. Fiona Foley and her team of eight Aboriginal artists aimed to challenge these concepts...'

(p. 14-43)






Abstract
'Fiona Foley identifies as a provocateur. This term, defined as ""a person who deliberately behaves controversially in order to provoke argument or other strong reactions"", is evident in the art she makes, her recent academic career, her public statements, writing and persona. In my recent biography, 'Fiona Foley Provocateur: An Art Life', I endeavour to describe the courage that this political positioning has always, and continues, to require from her. At its relentless heart is her family lineage which includes notable leaders, especially her mother Shirley Foley, whose vision for land on K'gari involved restoration of Badtjala possession of this special ""paradise."" Fiona's fight for justice extends to all Indigenous people, and more broadly to reconciliation, to the embrace of what she describes as the difficult, ""shared"" histories of those descended from Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander nations and incoming colonist and settler populations.'

Abstract
'In the recent Julian Schnabel film about Vincent van Gogh, At Eternity’s Gate, Vincent asserts, “I am my painting”. The lives of certain artists are often viewed popularly through the prism of biography.
'But in the contemporary art world, this perspective is not celebrated. Many art historians argue that the life of the artist should be viewed independently of the art. Indeed in Australia, suggests art historian Dr Sue Best, “This reductive [biographical] approach sheds almost no light on the art, except in some very unusual circumstances”.' (Introduction)

Abstract
'After the riots at Cronulla, I wrote about the separation of that event as a one-off in popular imaginings, while others were riotous flashpoints. The tricky manoeuvres of whiteness include its capacity to produce cultures of racialisation that demonise some, while exonerating the riotous behaviours of others. Aboriginal commentaries on the events at Cronulla were scarce, at that time. Since then, Aboriginal artists have provided commentary on the Cronulla riot as part of a wider critique of whiteness and racialisation in Australia. Fiona Foley’s series of photographs titled ‘Nulla 4 Eva’ infuse Aboriginal, Middle Eastern and Asian ethnicities onto the canvas of Cronulla’s whiteness. Vernon Ah Kee’s Cantchant series also provides commentary on the riots. These Aboriginal artists recall that racialised extremism is not a recent or one-off phenomenon in neocolonial Australia, while Sandra Hill’s Homemaker #6: Surfs Up asks who owns the beach? These artworks provide a reminder of the uneasy relationships between the identifications of Aboriginality and the groups that have arrived since invasion. Cronulla ‘ten years on’ was a time to reflect by including some of the understandings and commentaries of those with the longest memories of racialisation and processual whiteness, in Australia.'

Abstract
'The book Courting Blakness: Recalibrating Knowledge in the Sandstone University comes as a part of the art project ‘Courting Blakness,’ curated by the artist Fiona Foley, a Badtjala artist and Adjunct Professor at The University of Queensland, and brings together works by Ryan Presley, Archie Moore, Rea, Natalie Harkin, Karla Dickens, Christian Thompson, Megan Cope and Michael Cook. The art works, the live discussions, the website documenting the project, and finally the book – which reflects upon the art works, artists, the historical context of the work and the university space, are all integral parts of the project. The project invited these artists to reflect on identity, Aboriginality, the Australian nation, Western education, and architecture in the space of The University of Queensland. The book is a collection of essays, reflections and conversations fostered by the Courting Blakness project. ' (Author's introduction)

Abstract
'The Great Court of The University of Queensland at St Lucia is an everyday agora for students, staff and visitors, and a fondly-appreciated public space. Built and branded to underscore commitment to the development of Queensland's tertiary educational system, to secure the University's entry onto the list of elite ""sandstone universities"" dotted across Australia, and to create an iconic symbol of UQ's presence,1 (Moore, 19) the Great Court is lovely on a breezy, late spring afternoon, but it is by no means a neutral space/territory for everyone: the St Lucia campus is built upon Jagera and Turrbal country.'

Abstract
'Leonard French (1928–2017), who created the great stained-glass ceiling at the National Gallery of Victoria, was widely regarded as the most public Australian artist of his day. By the early 1970s this outgoing working-class boy from rough and tough inner-Melbourne Brunswick had become top of the artistic heap, his monumental glass commissions, murals and paintings were critically acclaimed and his commercial success was firmly established. A feisty contrarian with an eloquence that belied his humble origins, he delighted in publicly roasting the Australian art establishment, seeing its art historians, curators and caviling newspaper critics as his natural enemies. Yet suddenly in 1974 this public figure decided to shun the spotlight and seek solitude in Central Victoria. Why? All is revealed in this magnificent book by his long-time friend, Reg MacDonald.' (Publication summary)

BiographyHistory

×Bio changes summary
Close

Before the outbreak of the Second World War, writer and artist Donald Friend travelled extensively, living in England, France and West Africa. During the war he served in the artillery and was an official war artist from 1945-1946. His work from this period is collected in Fry and Fry's Donald Friend: Australian War Artist.
Following the war, Friend continued to travel, and lived in a number of locales, including Europe, Sri Lanka, New Guinea and Borneo, returning to Australia in 1980 due to ill health. 
His richly illustrated diary, which he kept from the age of 16 until just before his death, provided inspiration for much of his work and is now held by the National Library of Australia.

Abstract
'Donald Friend's legendary years in Bali in the 1960s and 70s and his subsequent final decade in Australia, are revealed in detail in this fourth and final volume of The Diaries Donald Friend. In Bali he lives luxuriously, like a lord - even keeping his own gamelan orchestra - and becomes an international celebrity artist. He welcomes guests such as Mick Jagger and the Duke and Duchess of Bedford, entertains numerous other visitors who want to buy his paintings and drawings and socialised freely with friends, including many other artists. He engages in significant building activity and property development while also producing superb illustrated manuscripts and books. And despite increasing ill-health, Friend continues to revel in his life's drama and creativity, remaining an eloquent, often charming and sometimes irascible companion. Including over 60 drawings from the diaries, many of them in colour, this volume confirms Friend's quicksilver creative brilliance and extraordinary insight. He is perhaps Australia's most important twentieth-century diarist. Published under the auspices of the Morris West Trust Fund.'

Abstract
'At age fourteen, Donald Friend declared: ""Have done quite a lot of painting lately, and have made up my mind that I shall be an artist. And I shall be famous!""
Friend achieved his aim. He also left behind more than two million words of brilliant, intimate diary entries—one of the greatest acts of autobiography in Australian history.
This is the first single-volume selection of these writings and includes material from the two 'lost' wartime diaries recently unearthed in America by Ian Britain, along with handsome sketches by Friend.
Everyone is here: Russell Drysdale, Margaret Olley, Jeffrey Smart, Robert Helpmann, Barry Humphries and Robert Hughes, Mick Jagger and Gore Vidal. Friend's frank and often acerbic reflections trace his career, acquaintances and love affairs—in Australia, England, Italy, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Bali—as well as many of the notable characters and events of the twentieth century.
Most of all, the diaries attest to his ceaseless desire to understand and master his art. Neither love, food, writing, money or music, nor flattery nor sincere admiration nor the company of friends (all the things I am most partial to),' Friend wrote, 'could seduce me from my painting.' Reworked into a chronological narrative, and supplemented by material from correspondence and interviews, The Donald Friend Diaries reveal an extraordinary Australian life.' (From the publisher's website.)

Abstract
'Covering the period January 1944 to March 1949, the extraordinary life of Australian artist Donald Friend continues in The Diaries of Donald Friend Volume 2. This is the second of four casebound volumes published by the National Library, revealing Friend's fine powers of observation, his irreverence and wit, his sensitivity and his marvellous eloquence. The diaries speak about art, love, friendship, travel, and much more, making absorbing reading as Friend experiences his final years of war service, both in Brisbane and as an official war artist; his return to Sydney where he lived with fellow artists in the colonial mansion Merioola; his travels to the Torres Strait Islands; and time spent in the old gold-mining town of Hill End. Including over 100 drawings from the diaries, this book is an essential publication for all lovers of art and great writing. Published under the auspices of the Morris West Trust Fund.'

Abstract
A chapbook 'history' of the fictitious Patty Freelove, who falls in love with Charles, the son of a neighbouring farmer. Charles, accused of killing game, is forced into military service with the 'Botany Bay Rangers,' and Patty, heartbroken, disguises herself as a man and joins up too. After a narrow escape in Rio De Janeiro, when 'a Portugese Lady, of great beauty and fortune' falls in love with the disguised Patty and hires 'ruffians' to kill her when her advances are spurned, the ship eventually arrives at Port Jackson. There they are soon attacked by 'natives,' and Patty, who fights with 'surprising courage' is wounded in the breast, and her sex is discovered. Patty and Charles marry and are allowed to return to England. At the end of the prose narrative is a brief account of the state of the colony, said to be related by Patty and Charles on their return. This includes some factual details, mentioning Arthur Phillip's wounding (in September 1790), and the parlous state of provisions in the early colony.The concluding 'New Song. Tune, The Hardy Tar,' recapitulates the events of the narrative in verse form.

Abstract
'I am writing in the front room of Murrays Cottage, where Donald Friend made his home for two years, until he left for Europe in March 1949. He visited again from time to time in later years. His friend Donald Murray remained in the cottage until his death in 1988, for Russell Drysdale and Friend had combined to purchase the cottage for him, Friend's stays in Hill End, and the extended stays by artist friends such as Russell Drysdale and Margaret Olley, transformed the almost deserted ex-goldmining town into the artists' colony it remains to this day. According to the local shopkeeper, the population of the town today is 117. In 1872, at the height of the gold rush, the population was anywhere between 10,000 and 30,000, depending on whom you believe.' (Introduction)

'At age fourteen, Donald Friend declared: ""Have done quite a lot of painting lately, and have made up my mind that I shall be an artist. And I shall be famous!""
Friend achieved his aim. He also left behind more than two million words of brilliant, intimate diary entries—one of the greatest acts of autobiography in Australian history.
This is the first single-volume selection of these writings and includes material from the two 'lost' wartime diaries recently unearthed in America by Ian Britain, along with handsome sketches by Friend.
Everyone is here: Russell Drysdale, Margaret Olley, Jeffrey Smart, Robert Helpmann, Barry Humphries and Robert Hughes, Mick Jagger and Gore Vidal. Friend's frank and often acerbic reflections trace his career, acquaintances and love affairs—in Australia, England, Italy, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Bali—as well as many of the notable characters and events of the twentieth century.

Abstract
'Donald Friend's legendary years in Bali in the 1960s and 70s and his subsequent final decade in Australia, are revealed in detail in this fourth and final volume of The Diaries Donald Friend. In Bali he lives luxuriously, like a lord - even keeping his own gamelan orchestra - and becomes an international celebrity artist. He welcomes guests such as Mick Jagger and the Duke and Duchess of Bedford, entertains numerous other visitors who want to buy his paintings and drawings and socialised freely with friends, including many other artists. He engages in significant building activity and property development while also producing superb illustrated manuscripts and books. And despite increasing ill-health, Friend continues to revel in his life's drama and creativity, remaining an eloquent, often charming and sometimes irascible companion. Including over 60 drawings from the diaries, many of them in colour, this volume confirms Friend's quicksilver creative brilliance and extraordinary insight. He is perhaps Australia's most important twentieth-century diarist. Published under the auspices of the Morris West Trust Fund.'

Abstract
""The notion of 'tropic days' conjures images of warmth and idleness, of reverie, of the flight from the cares and cold of the south, or the north, depending from where you are coming. In Tales from the Torrid Zone: Travels in the Deep Tropics, the English writer Alexander Frater defined le coup de bamboo, 'a mild form of tropic madness for which, luckily, there is no cure'. The tropics are the latitudes of escape - from work, from domestic responsibility. The ersatz myth-making of travel brochures emphasises these temporary possibilities. Yet the writers and painters whose lives we have mentioned found that North Queensland was the region where they could work most productively. They escaped, but into creative exertion, as much as from irksome calls on their time. Doing so, they spent their tropics days in ways that have enormously enriched Australian culture, its literature and art in particular.""

Abstract
'Covering the period January 1944 to March 1949, the extraordinary life of Australian artist Donald Friend continues in The Diaries of Donald Friend Volume 2. This is the second of four casebound volumes published by the National Library, revealing Friend's fine powers of observation, his irreverence and wit, his sensitivity and his marvellous eloquence. The diaries speak about art, love, friendship, travel, and much more, making absorbing reading as Friend experiences his final years of war service, both in Brisbane and as an official war artist; his return to Sydney where he lived with fellow artists in the colonial mansion Merioola; his travels to the Torres Strait Islands; and time spent in the old gold-mining town of Hill End. Including over 100 drawings from the diaries, this book is an essential publication for all lovers of art and great writing. Published under the auspices of the Morris West Trust Fund.'

single work 


autobiography 







Abstract
'George Gittoes defies categorisation as his life defies belief. One thing is certain: Gittoes is the greatest Australian hero working today and his epic story must be told.'Equal parts artist and warrior, George is world-famous for waging war on war with art, circus, photography and film. ""Soldiers die for flags. For me it is art,"" he says.'George has been shot, stabbed, bombed, beaten, tortured, drowned and jailed. He has worked with Andy Warhol, dined with Fidel Castro, plotted with Julian Assange, been feted by Mandela, blessed by Mother Theresa, sneezed on by the Dalai Lama.'Blood Mystic begins with George flying back to Jalalabad carrying a letter from the Taliban threatening to chop off his head and show the decapitation on live TV. George's mission is to film with street kids in the most dangerous city on earth - the Ghostbuster street exorcists, the Snow Monkey ice cream boys, the urchin girls and kuchi kids, the child gangsters with razor blades under their lips.'As the danger grows, George reflects deeply on a life less ordinary - his boyhood being groomed as a gangster, his escape to New York, the Yellow House art revolutions, crazy brave adventures in outback Australia, ghetto America, jungle Nicaragua, war-torn Cambodia, badlands Baghdad, hollow Bosnia... and beyond.

Abstract
'Seventeen extraordinary Australian directors respond to the hauntingly beautiful collection of short stories by Tim Winton. Spanning almost 30 years, these stories provide windows into the lives of men and women in the small coastal town of Angelus. Linking and overlapping, the stories create a stunning and disturbing portrait of a small coastal community in Western Australia. As befits the title of the film, the stories are preoccupied with the extraordinary turning points in ordinary people's lives. Relationships irretrievably alter, resolves are made or broken, and lives change direction forever.'Source: Screen Australia

Out on the waves together, the brothers finally address the weight they have been carrying around their whole lives, the weight that ended Frank's footy career.'Source: The Turning website (http://www.theturningmovie.com.au/#!/family/).

Abstract
'Shale compresses and covers, yet can erupt and crack and split and reveal what it has held firm, and shows that everything is interconnected, cause and effect. In this sense shale is Tasmania. Layer upon layer. A dark confusion.'

Abstract
'While filming around Tasmania, I slept many nights in my van, some outside it. I saw more stars than in previous years, and everything seemed crisper, clearer — not only due to upscaling from a HD to a 4k-resolution video camera. The intensity increased as the deadline approached. Michael Gissing and I collaborated on making a nine movement, 84 minute film as the back-drop of A Tasmanian Requiem.' (Introduction)

Abstract

'In a rush of remembrance that seemed longer than my own life, I recognised that was who we are, that there was a term for it, for our family-Aboriginal. At that point I began the long process of trying to understand what had happened that we had almost forgotten ourselves. Fugitive History: The Art of Julie Gough celebrates Gough's art practice, which has been central to her search for, and creation of, an identity for over twenty years. As an Aboriginal woman whose family from Tasmania had moved to Victoria and left behind connections to place and history, this search became as much about negotiating absence, distance, and lack, as discovery. This title includes essays by Brigita Ozolins, artist and senior lecturer at the Tasmanian College of the Arts; James Boyce, author of Born Bad and Van Diemen's Land, which won the Tasmanian Book Prize; and Khadija von Zinnenburg Carroll, Professorial Fellow and Chair of Global Art History in the Department of Art, Curating and Visual Studies at the University of Birmingham.

Abstract
'When I’m asked why I write poetry, what drives my writing, my answer usually settles on notions of responsibility that are not straightforward or easy to define. It can be a cathartic-compelling, a way of processing and responding to unexpected triggers, or reading and experiencing the work of others.' (Introduction)

BiographyHistory

×Bio changes summary
Close

Barbara Hanrahan was the only daughter of William Maurice ('Bob' ) Hanrahan and his wife Ronda (Goodridge). Her father died of tuberculosis the day after her first birthday. She grew up in her grandmother's house in Rose St, Thebarton with her mother (a commercial artist), her grandmother and her grandmother's sister Reece, who had Down Syndrome, and this background features strongly in her writing. She was educated at Thebarton infant, primary and technical schools. In 1955 she moved to Oaklands Park with her mother and new stepfather. She attended the Adelaide Teachers' College and the SA School of Art. 
Hanrahan began making prints in the early 1960s, and after teaching for a brief period she went to London (1963) and studied at the Central School of Art. After a year back in Adelaide she moved to London again in late 1965, and did not visit Australia again until 1973. As a child she had written and illustrated a novel, Emily of Sunnybrook, in an exercise book, basing it on L. M. Montgomery's Emily of New Moon. When she was about 19 she wrote stories for the Teachers' College magazine, Torch. Then, when she started to make prints, 'words got into them' . Whilst in London she began writing in earnest, when the death of her grandmother in 1968 awakened childhood memories. 'The old world was gone from me physically, yet it was inside my body, hurting so much it had to get out'. 
While appreciating the warmth and security of her childhood home, she rejected what she saw as the suburban mediocrity and conditioned conformity of her mother's and grandmother's lives. She and her partner, the Adelaide sculptor Jo Steele, who had himself reacted strongly against family and social pressures, chose not to marry or have children. In 1975 she taught for a year at the SA School of Art, and in 1978 she and Jo returned from London to live in Adelaide. They set up their studios in Thebarton. Barbara was a prolific artist, producing more than 400 different prints over the years, as well as a number of paintings, and her work was exhibited in Australia, London and France. She held over 30 one-woman exhibitions. She was Writer in Residence at the University of Adelaide for a period in 1987, and later the same year, at Rollins College, Florida (USA). 
In 1991 Hanrahan died of cancer. The Barbara Hanrahan Fellowship, a writing fellowship, has been created by the Arts Division of the SA Department of the Arts and Cultural Heritage, and the University of South Australia's City West campus has named the Barbara Hanrahan Building in her memory.

essay 







Abstract
'Barbara Hanrahan (1939-1991), who lived between Adelaide, London and Melbourne, was one of Australia's most distinctive artists. Characterised by playfully complex narratives that draw on both personal experience and fantasy, her works are fearlessly direct and unashamedly decorative.

'Bee-stung Lips reproduces more than 100 of Hanrahan's works on paper, while new essays by Nic Brown, Jacqueline Millner and Elspeth Pitt delve into the artist's themes, motivations and motifs, affirming the singularity of Hanrahan's vision and its relevance to our times thirty years after the artist's death in her prime.'

Abstract
Iris is the author's grandmother, and in her garden she is the centre of a feminine world. Her sister Reece, who grew up but remained a child, her daughter Ronda and her granddaughter Barbara people that world. At home or at school, on holidays by the sea or even growing up and leaving for art school in London, Barbara's thoughts keep returning to Iris.

Abstract
After Ronda's father passes away and her mother becomes too ill to care for her alone, they go to live with Ronda's grandparents and Reece, Ronda's aunt, four years older than Ronda and with Down syndrome. Ronda hates Reece and often bullies her. The grandparents also prefer to leave caring for Reece to Ronda's mother.
Some weekends, Ronda also goes to visit the elderly aunties and uncles at Adelaide Hills, each with their own peculiarities. As time passes, they each pass away, but Reece remains.

A delicious blend of fantasy and realism, it is a powerful, lyrical story of a child's rites of passage through a world where the family home, its garden, and the three women who preside over it, area vital and compelling participants in the shaping of a child's rituals of discovery and awareness.'

Abstract
'Barbara Hanrahan (1939-1991), who lived between Adelaide, London and Melbourne, was one of Australia's most distinctive artists. Characterised by playfully complex narratives that draw on both personal experience and fantasy, her works are fearlessly direct and unashamedly decorative.

'Bee-stung Lips reproduces more than 100 of Hanrahan's works on paper, while new essays by Nic Brown, Jacqueline Millner and Elspeth Pitt delve into the artist's themes, motivations and motifs, affirming the singularity of Hanrahan's vision and its relevance to our times thirty years after the artist's death in her prime.'

criticism 








— Appears in: 
		








Claiming Space for Australian Women's Writing






2017;




(p. 227-241)






Abstract
'This chapter explores Barbara Hanrahan’s notion that sexuality “can manifest itself in all sorts of ways” disrupts the naturalised binary logic that governs cultural intelligibility about what constitutes “real” sex and what remains unimaginable and unspeakable. It also highlights a preoccupation in her writing with non-normative sexual desires and identities that is akin to the critical concerns of queer epistemologies. The chapter takes Hanrahan’s contestation of normative thinking about sexuality as a starting point to critically examine the queerness of her “fantastic novels”. By reading Hanrahan’s fiction queerly we are offered a valuable critique that challenges the normalising power of heterosexuality and its claims to be the only intelligible and “natural” way to organise desire.'

Abstract
'Bruce Bennett and Anne Pender explore the lives and creative work of Australia's many expatriate writers living and working in Britain since the early nineteenth century. They contest the notion of Australia as an 'import culture' and show Australians exporting literary talent to Britain and further afield from 1820 until the present. Stories of the lives and work of writers working in all genres, from romance and crime to contemporary literary fiction, are interweaved in a collective biography.Bennett and Pender uncover many unknown writers and document their adventures both on and off the page. They also discover the expatriate lives of figures such as Pamela Travers (author of Mary Poppins), Frederic Manning, Randolph Stow and Madeleine St John. They explore the work of lesser known writers such as Jill Neville, as well as investigating Christina Stead's expatriate years, the modernist dramas of Patrick White and Barry Humphries, and the arguments with England expressed in the lives and work of Peter Porter, Germaine Greer, Michael Blakemore and Geoffrey Robertson.This book is the first historically comprehensive, detailed examination of expatriate Australian writers at work in Britain. The authors illuminate two centuries of intense literary activity and discover the major contributions by Australian writers to world literature.'Source: Monash University Publishing website

Barbara Hanrahan : A Biography

Z1771018

2010



single work 


biography 







Abstract
'Barbara Hanrahan wrote: 'It is a struggle ... to be me ... to accept ME, and my spiritual purpose.'

This authoritative biography illuminates the life of a great Australian 
writer and artist. The story starts with Barbara Hanrahan's childhood in
 Adelaide, travels with her to 'swinging London' of the 1960s, and 
recounts her remarkable achievements in Britain and Australia in the 
following decades. Like the artists she most admired - among them, 
William Blake, Frida Kahlo and D.H. Lawrence - Barbara Hanrahan 
dedicated herself uncompromisingly to the life of the mind and spirit, 
producing a body of work that remains challenging and rewarding.

Annette Stewart has drawn on a wealth of unpublished material, including
 the artist's letters, photographs, prints and diaries, as well as 
interviews with her friends and her partner, the sculptor Jo Steele.

Barbara Hanrahan is beautifully illustrated with a number of 
Hanrahan's artworks, some of which have not been published before, and 
many photographs from her life.' (Publisher's blurb)

Towards a Poetics of the 'Unhomed': The House in Katherine Mansfield's 'Prelude' and Barbara Hanrahan's The Scent of Eucalyptus

Abstract
Masgrau-Peya examines 'the representation of home and the domestic myth in Mansfield's 'Prelude' and in Hanrahan 's The Scent of the Eucalyptus, concentrating on their simultaneous presentation of the fiction of domestic bliss and the repudiation of the ideological tenets that inform it.' Masgrau-Peya argues that being 'unhoused' for most of their adult lives, Mansfield and Hanrahan eschewed the 'comforts of either home or conventional family'. Their writing, even when recognising the 'warmth and security' of family and the 'comforts of home' also acknowledges 'the politics of repression, exclusion and exploitation that make them possible.'

Abstract
Analyses women's spirituality in the larger context of Australian Desert Spirituality, concluding that women have been developing their own forms of religious expression. General chapters examine'malestream' spirituality, on the one hand,  and explore the way 'real' women  express their religious and spiritual experiences in non-fiction; the next three chapters offer a close investigation of the fictions of Thea Astley, Elizabeth Jolley and Barbara Hanrahan.

Imaginative Possession : Evocation of Place in Works by David Malouf, Barbara Hanrahan and Gerald Murnane





Alex Rombouts

1990




Z862732

1990



single work 


thesis 







Abstract
'This is a study of Johnno by David Maiouf (1975), The Scent of Eucalyptus by Barbara Hanrahan (1973), and Tamarisk Row by Gerald Mumane (1974). These three writers have realised, in a way which is distinctive, an imaginative possession of and by place. Each of them has imaginatively taken hold of his/her own particular place and in so doing has found a way to belong. I do not say 'belong to Australia as a whole', because for them it does not exist as a single, cohesive entity. Rather these writers find their own features in their own particular place. Theirs are alternative maps, not merely of Australia but of Brisbane and Adelaide and Bendigo, recreated according to their own experiences and the shaping force of these places on them.'

Abstract
'Barbara Hanrahan was both a writer and a visual artist, and this magical first novel is an autobiographical evocation of her childhood. A delicious blend of fantasy and realism, it is a powerful, lyrical story of a child's rites of passage through a world where the family home, its garden, and the three women who preside over it, area vital and compelling participants in the shaping of a child's rituals of discovery and awareness.'

(p. 22-25)






Abstract
'I’ve heard of that place, Australia. There are even some memories that persist of it as a discrete, identifiable object. It was a thing taught to me in primary school in jovial, unambiguous ways. It was a series of tales of sheep, and rushes of gold, and the bushranging bloke with a metal bucket on his head. It played cricket against the West Indies. It was precisely 200 years old and we dressed as convicts and walked down the town’s main street to celebrate this fact. All incompleteness and lies that I felt disconnected from then, as I do now.'  (Introduction)

'The Sex Thing Is Strange' : The Queerness of Barbara Hanrahan’s Fiction

,
		


2017



single work 


criticism 








— Appears in: 
		








Claiming Space for Australian Women's Writing






2017;




(p. 227-241)






Abstract
'This chapter explores Barbara Hanrahan’s notion that sexuality “can manifest itself in all sorts of ways” disrupts the naturalised binary logic that governs cultural intelligibility about what constitutes “real” sex and what remains unimaginable and unspeakable. It also highlights a preoccupation in her writing with non-normative sexual desires and identities that is akin to the critical concerns of queer epistemologies. The chapter takes Hanrahan’s contestation of normative thinking about sexuality as a starting point to critically examine the queerness of her “fantastic novels”. By reading Hanrahan’s fiction queerly we are offered a valuable critique that challenges the normalising power of heterosexuality and its claims to be the only intelligible and “natural” way to organise desire.'

Reading Across the Pacific : Australia-United States Intellectual Histories






2010;




(p. 323-338)






Abstract
'The University of Queensland Press was transformed from a merely scholarly into a creative independent Australian publisher partly through the agency of the American publisher Frank Thompson. In the explosive days of the late 1960s and early 1970s, and with Australians' complex fascination with United States, Thompson embodied the democratic challenge to the old British dominated regime on campus and in publishing circles. This paper will explore pivotal books published by UQP notably Thomas Shapcott's Contemporary American and Australian Poetry in 1976; UQP's development of the American market with the distribution of UQP literary fiction and the establishment of an American office; and co-publishing with American publishers and editing Australian books for American readers in a different hemisphere. Thompson's own assessment of his successes and failures will be contextualised in terms of political developments and those issues long associated with Australian literature - environmental representation and expatriatism.'

Towards a Poetics of the 'Unhomed': The House in Katherine Mansfield's 'Prelude' and Barbara Hanrahan's The Scent of Eucalyptus

(p. 60-66)






Abstract
Masgrau-Peya examines 'the representation of home and the domestic myth in Mansfield's 'Prelude' and in Hanrahan 's The Scent of the Eucalyptus, concentrating on their simultaneous presentation of the fiction of domestic bliss and the repudiation of the ideological tenets that inform it.' Masgrau-Peya argues that being 'unhoused' for most of their adult lives, Mansfield and Hanrahan eschewed the 'comforts of either home or conventional family'. Their writing, even when recognising the 'warmth and security' of family and the 'comforts of home' also acknowledges 'the politics of repression, exclusion and exploitation that make them possible.'

Abstract
Discusses how White Australia is haunted by a sense of being 'illegitimately in a place'. In relation to works by Astley, Hanrahan and New Zealand writer Janet Frame, the author examines the concepts of home, safety and cultural security and addresses the questions of 'what it means to be geographically located on the edge of the Pacific'.

Imaginative Possession : Evocation of Place in Works by David Malouf, Barbara Hanrahan and Gerald Murnane

1990



single work 


thesis 







Abstract
'This is a study of Johnno by David Maiouf (1975), The Scent of Eucalyptus by Barbara Hanrahan (1973), and Tamarisk Row by Gerald Mumane (1974). These three writers have realised, in a way which is distinctive, an imaginative possession of and by place. Each of them has imaginatively taken hold of his/her own particular place and in so doing has found a way to belong. I do not say 'belong to Australia as a whole', because for them it does not exist as a single, cohesive entity. Rather these writers find their own features in their own particular place. Theirs are alternative maps, not merely of Australia but of Brisbane and Adelaide and Bendigo, recreated according to their own experiences and the shaping force of these places on them.' (Paragraph one, Introduction)

Abstract
'This book celebrates the extraordinary life of artist Elaine Haxton and illustrates with beautiful reproductions the range and quality of her work, asserting her rightful place as a significant twentieth century Australian artist.
'From the time Haxton entered East Sydney Technical College aged 14, art became her passion and her livelihood, and she was always searching and learning. Although based in Sydney, at various times she studied in London, New York, Paris and Kyoto, and experiences in many countries continually expanded her approaches to art.
'Through hard work, flair and endless energy, she produced fine work in many spheres, always seriously reviewed and respectfully acclaimed. At the same time, she lived in a social whirl, a darling of the press, but loved and rewarded in the top echelons of the Australian art world.'

Abstract
'Meet Alice Anderson – a gay mechanic and entrepreneur in 1920s Melbourne
'Meet Joy Hester – a fierce, angry, larger-than life artist in 1940s Melbourne
'Meet Elizabeth Gould – mother, lover, wife, artist of colonial Australia in the 1800s
'Meet Dawn Faizey-Webster – a woman with locked in syndrome completing her PhD with the blink of an eye.
'These remarkable women have been relegated to the sidelines of history and it’s time to bring them centre stage. In four interweaving, funny, moving, thought-provoking monologues, two actors – Mary Steuten and Tess Parker – inhabit these extraordinary women, telling their stories with truth, rawness and vulnerability.'

Abstract
'JOY is an intimate theatrical exploration of Joy Hester's fascinating life by Melbourne playwright Christine Croyden. Performed by actor Claire Larisse Nicholls and directed by Sara Grenfell, the play takes the audience through a series of poignant and revelatory moments and Hester’s encounters with characters such as Sunday Reed, Albert Tucker, and Gray Smith. Poltergeists and dreams break through the piece theatrically and in a haunting soundscape with an original score performed by musician and composer Rosie Westbrook.'

Where is Joy?





Amy Hyslop

2004



single work 


drama 







Abstract
Working as both a painter and a draftsman in bohemian 1940s and 1950s Melbourne, Hester's work was unrecognised during her lifetime and compromised by the demands of motherhood and domesticity and by an illness that would take her life at age forty. 'Where is Joy?'  is an exploration of creativity constrained by duty and of a life lived outside conventional morality. http://www.brisbane247.com/show_place.asp?fmt=b&place_id=6678 (Sighted 18/10/04)

Abstract
'The prominent Australian artist Nora Heysen has been said to have worked in the shadow of her father Hans Heysen, one of Australia's most recognised landscape painters. Letters between the two, however, reveal a different story.
'In 1934, when Nora first travelled to London to study art, she experienced her first time away from home and the first of many, often exotic places from where she would write home to Hahndorf, South Australia. The correspondence between Nora and Hans continued until his death in 1968. Theirs was a close and affectionate relationship, in which father and daughter shared a lifetime of thoughts about art and life, and a mutual admiration and respect for each other's work.
'Heysen to Heysen is a showcase of letters between Nora and Hans Heysen from the collection of the National Library of Australia. Accompanied by carefully selected images and text by leading art historian Catherine Speck, the publication lifts the lid on a vista of Australian art.' (From the publisher's website.)

Abstract
'Nora Heysen wasn’t the only talented artist in the family. As a young woman, her painting was extraordinary, but she could never get out from the shadow of her dad. She took her talents to London to carve her own identity, but male teachers and critics told her that her work wasn’t very good.
'It was.
'Back in Australia, Nora was the first woman to win Australia’s biggest portrait prize, the Archibald.  She was also the first woman to be sent to war as a war artist.  She documented many women at war, and in the last years of her life, was finally recognized as one of the finest portrait painters Australia has ever seen.'  (Production summary)

Abstract
'Hahndorf artist Nora Heysen was the first woman to win the Archibald Prize, and Australia’s first female painter to be appointed as an official war artist. A portraitist and a flower painter, Nora Heysen’s life was defined by an all-consuming drive to draw and paint. In 1989, aged 78, Nora re-emerged on the Australian art scene as the nation’s major art institutions restored her position after years of artistic obscurity.
'Extensively researched by the author, Nora Heysen: A Portrait is the first biography of the artist, and it has been enthusiastically embraced by the Heysen family.'

'Nora Heysen grew up at The Cedars near the Adelaide Hills town of Hahndorf, and was deeply influenced by her father, Hans Heysen. Nora Heysen: Light and life explores a notable career spanning seven decades, during which the artist painted some of Australia's most outstanding self-portraits, became the country's first female war artist, and was the first woman to win the prestigious Archibald Prize.

'Curator and author Jane Hylton has written extensively on Australian art and has curated numerous exhibitions. In 2000 she left the position of Curator of Australian Art at the Art Gallery of South Australia to become a freelance consultant.' (Publication summary)

single work 


biography 







Abstract
'Jackie was born wise, and born unperturbed,' said Jeffrey Smart of his friend Jacqueline Hick. Jacqueline Hick (1919-2004) was one of Australia's most successful figurative painters. In a long and fruitful career she also explored print-making and enamelling. Her subjects included the Australian landscape, musical and theatrical performances, and city life. Above all, Hick was drawn to the human figure. Whether observing the foibles of modern living or the displacement of Aboriginal people's traditional lifestyles, her figurative works sought to expose human insensitivity. Jacqueline Hick: Born wise showcases many of Hick's finest works, and traces a life that, like her art, was imbued with wit, wisdom and empathy.' (Publisher's blurb)

Abstract
'The courtship of Andrew Jack, a steamship officer working in India and Ceylon, and Mary Travers, of a Tasmanian farming family, was recorded for posterity in a series of witty, touching and eloquent letters the pair exchanged between 1928 and 1931. These have been gathered in this volume along with historical notes by Mary's relatives and contemporary photographs reprinted from the original negatives for this book. This book gives a fascinating glimpse into another time and place and a timeless romance.' (Publisher's blurb)

Abstract
''Carcoola Holiday' has all the sparkling humor of Miss Handford's previous books for girls. As a counter to the feminine activities of Hope, and the twins Ann-Anne and Dimity, the two boys Rory and Jonesy, familiar figures to readers of the Carcoola books, provide their own quota of nuisance-creating. This time they decide to write a radio serial. The result may easily be imagined.'A new and welcome addition to the Carcoola characters is a New Australian girl, Zelie. The gradual acceptance of the Australian way of life by this Czech girl is described by the authoress with sympathy and sincerity.'For young readers who crave excitement, there plenty of that type of action to be expected on an Australian sheep station.'Source:'Book Review: ""Carcoola Holiday"",' Newcastle Sun, 22 October 1953, p.21.

Abstract
'The extent to which the seventeenth-century Dutch 'discovery' of the great southern continent we now call Australia had a cataclysmic impact on European cosmology is open to conjecture. But it is certain that the historical failures by Europeans to 'see' or understand the realities of the Australian land, its people and its creatures — as evidenced throughout history - have continued right up to the present. Despite the inadequacies of European tropes, genres, classification systems and ways of thinking in coming to terms with the challenges of understanding this southern continent, northern hemisphere frameworks of thinking in the sciences and humanities still persist.'

Abstract
‘Straylya’. That's how I can remember first hearing it – stray-lya – as if it was a place filled with strays. I wasn’t aware at that very young age of paying too much attention to the origins of the country’s name. But later I recall a growing sense of satisfaction that it suited the place my small family had decided to make their home. My parents had been dedicated strayers well before they got here. They’d ridden motorbikes all across Scotland and the north of England in the postwar years. Proud owners of a BSA Golden Flash, they were members of a club that set off each weekend to rumble through the Royal Mile and head out beyond the Edinburgh boundary lines, into the moorlands and hills and glens. When I came along there was a sidecar added, and I became the club’s baby. Lots of pictures of me being passed around – all rugged up with fat, wind-chafed cheeks – to members posing proudly by bikes lined up against backgrounds of fairly grim grey landscapes. Looking back at those old photos now, I realise the club was training me in the art of straying.

Abstract
‘Straylya’. That's how I can remember first hearing it – stray-lya – as if it was a place filled with strays. I wasn’t aware at that very young age of paying too much attention to the origins of the country’s name. But later I recall a growing sense of satisfaction that it suited the place my small family had decided to make their home. My parents had been dedicated strayers well before they got here. They’d ridden motorbikes all across Scotland and the north of England in the postwar years. Proud owners of a BSA Golden Flash, they were members of a club that set off each weekend to rumble through the Royal Mile and head out beyond the Edinburgh boundary lines, into the moorlands and hills and glens. When I came along there was a sidecar added, and I became the club’s baby. Lots of pictures of me being passed around – all rugged up with fat, wind-chafed cheeks – to members posing proudly by bikes lined up against backgrounds of fairly grim grey landscapes. Looking back at those old photos now, I realise the club was training me in the art of straying.

BiographyHistory

×Bio changes summary
Close

Quentin Hole was an author, illustrator of children's books, and costume and set designer. He spent his childhood on a sheep station and received his primary school education through the Queensland correspondence school. He attended Brisbane Boys College as a boarder for his secondary education.
During the World War II, Hole served with the Australian Army and afterwards undertook a course in commercial art at Brisbane Technical College Art School. There he concentrated on painting and design. He then travelled around Queensland and New South Wales painting and exhibiting. In 1953 he went to London where he worked for two years at the Central School of Art, and exhibited at the Imperial Institute Galleries. Hole, in collaboration with Don Cowen, painted two murals for the Geology Museum at the University of Queensland. The first mural, painted in 1951, is on the theme of 'The Age of Reptiles', while the second, painted in 1952, is on 'The Age of Mammals', particularly focusing on the local megafauna. Hole independently painted a third mural in 1958, depicting the pliosaur Kronosaurus queenslandicus.
On his return to Australia Hole painted, taught and designed for Brisbane theatrical productions, including Aristophanes' Lysistrata at the Twelfth Night Theatre. In 1958 he moved to Melbourne and took up the position of designer for the Union Theatre Company. In 1962 he joined the staff of the Australian Broadcasting Commission where he designed sets for period dramas and operas including Seven Little Australians, Ride on Stranger and Madame Butterfly. Hole has also designed productions for the Australian Opera. 
During the 1970s, Hole's friend Anne Ingram (q.v.), Children's Editor of William Collins, encouraged him to illustrate children's books. The first text he chose was The Man From Ironbark by A. B. Paterson (q.v.) and his illustrated version subsequently won the 1975 Australian Picture Book of the Year Award.

Abstract
The man from Ironbark, a real bushman, is visiting Sydney for the first time. He finds the rush and bustle too exhausting so he decides to rest in a barber's and enjoy a shave. The barber, 'small and flash' tries to pull a joke on the bushman but comes off second best because his victim is a man whose actions speak louder than words.

Abstract
'There was a sacred hill, It had been there for as long as time itself. Mobs of kangaroos, living on the sacred hill, looked after the land and the land looked after them. Blue, Treez, Potsy and Rocko are happy on the sacred hill until some rowdy myna birds disturb the peace. The roos are forced to leave their land, but thoughts of the hill are never far away. Soon they unite, embarking on an adventure that will lead them back home to the sacred hill. Accompanied by activities to complete at home or in the classroom, The Sacred Hill is an inspiring tale, showing that courage and friendship can go a long way.' (Source: TROVE)

Spiritual Journeying : The Art of Tim Johnson

biography 







Abstract
'As a young Australian artist, Tim Johnson sought to look beyond the world he knew and was familiar with into mysteries that naturally come with things foreign. He wanted to explore what it was like to exist beyond the margins of his known world and to reach into alternative spaces that interested him. This book documents his spiritual journeying and creative explorations. In 1980, Johnson's encounter with Aboriginal artists in the deserts of central Australia revolutionised his entire approach to art and life. In 1982, when he learned of the existence of the ancient medieval Buddhist cave temples of Mogao at Dunhuang in Western China, the experience also set his imagination aflame. The caves were an inspirational oasis of spirituality on the Silk Road and another powerful artistic expression in desert country. These two spiritual and artistic traditions inspired the path Johnson was to take over the next four decades. Over time his work expanded to include references to Japanese, Tibetan, Native American and a range of other sources and influences. Today, as a veteran artist, he has created an imagined universe abundantly informed by influences and ideas.' (Publication summary)

‘While I Knew I Was Raced, I Didn’t Think Much of It’ : The Need for Racial Literacy in Decolonising Classrooms

(p. 82-103)






Abstract
'International recognition of racial literacy is growing as a field of postcolonial scholarship but has yet to gain momentum in Australia. In this article, we argue for the need to develop a racial literacy approach for Australian contexts and draw on a qualitative study which engaged with university students who participated in the subject Racial Literacy: Indigeneity and Whiteness delivered at an Australian university. The experiences of these students, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous, reveal the classroom to be reflective of broader tensions that manifest in relation to race as a topic and can be a critical space for racial literacy and decolonising education. We argue here that the application of racial literacy is required to address the significant anomaly that exists between critical race scholarship, common understandings of race, colonisation and the practices and impacts of racism. We contend that to develop a racial literacy approach, which does not perpetuate the limits of critical race studies, the role of race in Indigenous dispossession and the ongoing legacies of colonisation must consistently be foundational.'

anthology 


life story 







Abstract
The stories recorded in this book trace the oral history of the families of Warmun community dating back to the time of first contact and interaction with foreigners. Elders speak of that time by describing life on cattle stations and the way culture was maintained in an increasingly alien environment. Other contributors tell of the move to the present community site and explain how aspects of their culture are still maintained and transmitted by the people of Warmun community.

Abstract
'When I'm a famous marine scientist I'll live on a boat by myself. I'll snorkel on the reef all day long. But before I can learn to snorkel I have to be able to swim properly. And right now, I don't even own a swimsuit. 
'Eleven year old Tilly dreams of becoming a marine scientist. But she lives in a drought stricken town with her mum and younger brother Oliver, who is autistic. Oliver's meltdowns are making life unbearable. He can't cope with even the smallest of changes to his routine. On top of that, he needs so many different kinds therapy that there's never any time or money left over for swimming lessons.
'When Mum loses her job and decides to move the family to the Queensland coast, Tilly is excited and terrified all at once. Is this her chance to finally learn to swim? Will her dream of snorkelling on the Great Barrier Reef come true? Or will so many changes all at once prove too much for the whole family?'

Abstract
'There are not many dugongs left in the world now. But what if humans freed the sea from nets? What if we cleared it of rubbish so that seagrass could flourish again and dugongs could feed?
'A beautiful and thought-provoking picture book about dugongs - the mysterious creatures who were once mistaken for mermaids. Deborah's Kelly's beautiful, lyrical writing brings these animals to life, and highlights the dangers they face, inspiring young readers to care for and protect our natural world. Lisa Stewart's gorgeous illustrations capture the beauty of these gentle and endangered creatures.'

Abstract
'Zane is different to other kids. He has his own made-up language. He likes to line things up. And he is frightened of things that don't seem to bother other people - like the colour black. His father gets frustrated and angry with Zane. His mother tries hard to explain things to him. But nothing seems to work. Zane just scrunches himself up into a ball and screams. Things are looking pretty bleak for Zane and his family; that is, until Zane's big sister starts to draw a chalk rainbow at the top of the front steps ... The Chalk Rainbow explores difference and diversity through a family living with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). It's also a story of unconditional love, of trust and of learning to look at the world through the eyes of others. The story is told by Zane's older sister in a way that young children can easily relate to. The ending is uplifting as all members of the family learn to look at things differently and find a way to move forward together.' (Publication summary)

Lucy Napaljarri Kennedy grew up at Coniston Station. Her father hunted dingoes for scalps to sell to the station owners. Kennedy milked cows and worked as a housegirl doing domestic duties. When Yuendumu Mission was established in 1946, many people moved there from Coniston Station, Mount Doreen, and Ti-tree. Her people belong to the Yunkaranyi (Honey Ant) Dreaming.

Wild Yam Dreaming : The Phytopoetics of Emily Kame Kngwarreye





John Charles Ryan 
,
		


2020



single work 


criticism 








— Appears in: 
		








Plumwood Mountain [Online]



,
March





2020;








Abstract
'Anmatyerre elder and artist Emily Kame Kngwarreye (1910–1996) of the Utopia community, Northern Territory, Australia, featured the growth patterns of the pencil yam (Vigna lanceolata) prominently in works such as Untitled (Yam) (1981), Anooralya – Wild Yam (1989) and Yam Dreaming (1996) as well as a number of black-and-white renderings. Through the yam-art of Kngwarreye, this article considers human-vegetal entanglements in Aboriginal Australian societies. Integral to appreciating Kngwarreye’s paintings, the plant-poiesis-people conjunction calls prominence to ancestral—or Dreaming—knowledge of yams not only as providores of material sustenance but also as agential beings-in-themselves who culture humankind across space and time.'

Emily Kame Kngwarreye : The Impossible Modernist

— Appears in:

vol.

2017;




(p. 42-49)






Abstract
'Art critic Robert Hughes made the assessment that Aboriginal art was the last great art movement of the twentieth century.1 It started at the Aboriginal community called Papunya, in which Aboriginal men had been painting on canvas for the outside market with great success since the 1980s. The Papunya art style as it became known, sometimes compared to forms of Western modernism - from abstract expressionism to minimalism and even conceptual art - presented a comparison that was rarely taken literally, although some critics of the 1987 Dreamings exhibition in New York did wonder if the Aboriginal artists had been appropriating New York art. But when it came to the late paintings of Emily Kame Kngwarreye, critics really did start to question the relationship between modernism and Western Desert painting, ascribing to her the genius and expressive freedom associated with the masters of Western modernism.'

Abstract
'Emily Kame Kngwarreye is one of the most important abstract painters of the 20th century and one of the most significant artists that Australia has ever produced. Emily’s strikingly modern and beautifully innovative works, created in an environment far away from the influence of the Western Art tradition, have been featured in over 100 exhibitions in the last decade and are housed in collections all over the world. This book has been published to support a major international exhibition, presented by the National Museum of Australia, that opened in Japan in 2007 and travels to Australia this year. Utopia: The Genius of Emily Kame Kngwarreye features over 120 works drawn from private, public and corporate collections around the world, telling the story of Emily Kame Kngwarreye as one of Australia’s greatest contemporary artists, and also giving some insight into her life as a senior Anmatyerre woman and a lifelong custodian of the desert country that inspired her work.'

BiographyHistory

×Bio changes summary
Close

Jack Koskie commenced his formal art education by studying on a scholarship at the Hull College of Arts, but at the age of 16, he signed on as a deck-hand on a North Atlantic trawler. Migrating to Australia in 1939, Koskie worked as an engraver on the The Herald (Melbourne) . When World War II broke out, Koskie unsuccessfully tried to join the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), but eventually served as a sapper with the Australian Army during 1941-1944.
After the war, Koskie worked as a freelance illustrator and designer for numerous publishing companies, including Invincible Press and the Currawong Publishing Company. He served as chief designer for the Commonwealth Office of Education (Sydney, NSW, ca.1950), where he frequently produced cover designs for the Current Affairs Bulletin. Koskie eventually left the art field in 1954 to take up teaching at Hobart Technical College. He produced a book of maritime paintings, Ships That Shaped Australia (Angus and Robertson, North Ryde, New South Wales, 1987). In 1979, Koskie retired from his position as lecturer in printmaking at Deakin University (Victoria).

BiographyHistory

×Bio changes summary
Close

Marguerite Mahood was a writer, potter, printmaker, graphic artist and watercolourist, who studied painting at the National Gallery School, Melbourne, and ceramics at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. She established herself as a professional artist, producing decorative drawings and watercolours, linocuts and oil paintings and often exhibited with the Victorian Artists Society. In the late 1920s she gave weekly broadcasts on design, its history and techniques in the visual arts on ABC radio.
During the 1930s and 1940s, Marguerite and her husband were active members of the Communist Party of Australia and Mahood assisted the cause by producing posters, leaflets, banners and other promotional material. 
Mahood began working on animal drawings and produced an illustrated children's book, The Whispering Stone: An Australian Nature Fantasy (1944), and as 'Margot Mahood', she drew children's cartoons devoted to Australian animals and also produced a book in 1952, Drawing Australian Animals. Mahood returned to study in the late 1950s, gaining her Master of Arts degree, and her lifelong interest in cartoons culminated in a Ph.D. in history from the University of Melbourne on Australian political caricature. Her thesis was published as The Loaded Line: Australian Political Caricature 1788- 1901 (1973).
She contributed articles on colonial cartoonists for the Australian Dictionary of Biography and continued to hold several solo exhibitions at the Lyceum Club and Jim Alexanders Gallery, Melbourne.

Abstract
Sandy doesn't win a prize on school prize day - which is not surprising, because he doesn't pay attention in class.  Still, he feels a little bit disappointed. He suddenly remembers a ""Treasure"" left behind at the homestead where he lives by a visiting Aboriginal tribe many years before. It is a ""hard little bundle"" wrapped in bark and tied with string. Perhaps its magic can help him. Sandy then has a great adventure that leads to even greater understanding.

BiographyHistory

×Bio changes summary
Close

A Czech-born surrealist, Dusan Marek fled to Australia with his brother Voitre on political grounds, after the Communist takeover of Czechoslovakia. A 'self-proclaimed surrealist at the age of thirteen, Marek carried that talisman until his death at the age of 67 in 1993' (Mould, p.15).
Born on the 7 March 1926 in Bitouchov, Northern Bohemia (in what was then Czechoslovakia), Marek lived in Prague, Czech Republic, between around 1943 and 1948: imagery from this area recurs in his earliest films in Australia, such as Fisherman's Holiday (1952). In 1948, Marek and his brother Voitre left Czechoslovakia on political grounds and spent March to July 1948 in a refugee camp in Dillenberg, Germany, where Marek produced what were widely thought to be his earliest paintings, 'The Voyage' and 'The Birth of Love', which he painted on the wooden slats of his bed. (See Stephen Mould for details on Marek's pre-1948 works.)
Marek and his brother travelled to Australia in mid-July 1948 on the SS Charleton Sovereign; delays on the journey meant that the ship did not dock in Sydney until 29 October 1948. From here, the Marek brothers moved to the Immigration and Training Centre at Bathurst, New South Wales, where Voitre was reunited with his fiancee, who had travelled to Australia on a separate boat, and Marek met his future wife, Helena.
According to Stephen Mould, the Mareks chose to settle in Adelaide after it was enthusiastically recommended to them by an administrator in the Bathurst camp: 'Dusan was on a contract to work for the South Australian Government for two years, and took a job with SA Railways. After a few weeks, both brothers found themselves able to negotiate with their skills as jewellers, and found employment with Sheppard's Jewellers in Adelaide' (p.5).
Both brothers also began exhibiting as artists while living in Adelaide, but their introduction to the South Australian art community was not a salubrious one; in a 1949 exhibition by the Adelaide branch of the Contemporary Art Society, for example, two of Marek's works were declared obscene, and either 'banned at the selection stage and later displayed, or ... completely withdrawn' (Mould, p.6). Mould attributes this to a conservative swing in the Adelaide art world, prompted by such recent events as the Ern Malley affair and the 1944 William Dobell trial (p.6), but the end result was that Dusan Marek left Adelaide in 1951, settled in Hobart, Tasmania, for some six months, and then moved on to Sydney.
In Sydney, Marek earned a living through jewellery making (Mould, p.8), but also began his experiments with films, beginning with the short films Fisherman's Holiday and Light of the Darkness (both 1952), both of them surreal, animated films using stop-motion animation and plasticine figurines.
Marek remained in Sydney for three years before moving to Papua New Guinea: first Port Moresby (for some six months), then Rabaul, in New Britain. As Stephen Mould notes, 'this period marks a significant fallow period in comparison to the constant need to work and create that marks the rest of his adult life' (p.10). He did produce the short film Nightmare (1956): the short animated film Spaceman Number One, also produced in 1956, was actually filmed during a brief return to Adelaide. However, Marek also produced documentary films during this period: the actual number is unclear, but the National Film and Sound Archive (NFSA) does contain a print of a documentary called Mountain Festival in Britain, showing the preparations for and participation in the 'mountain festival'.
In 1959, Marek returned to Adelaide, where he became caretaker at the Kym Bonython Gallery. His film production increased in this period. Among his works in this period are the series of short animated films (using the stop-motion and paper cut-out technique he had first used for Spaceman Number One) based on nursery rhymes (sometimes loosely grouped together in bibliographies under the umbrella title Nursery Rhymes), as well as the short, fantastic films The Bachelor's Lament (1959), King Arthur (1959), One Dotty Adventure (1961), Ship A Sailin' (c.1960), and Adam and Eve (1962). The last of these films, Adam and Eve, won the Grand Prix (Gold Medal) at the Australian Film Awards in 1963, and Stephen Mould also notes that Marek's films won 'international awards at festivals in Vancouver, Venice and Chicago' (p.11), though he does not specify which awards or festivals.
Marek's increasing focus on films drew the attention of Fontana Films, 'a Sydney-based company which employed a number of Czech émigrés. Marek was provided with a studio and a salary. Apart from a fairly light workload making some TV commercials and animations, he was free to continue his creative work using the resources of the Fontana Studio.' (Mould, p.11). The NFSA holds an advertising showreel of Marek's advertisements from this period, made using the paper cut-out, stop-motion animation with which he had been working since the late 1950s, including advertisements for Speedie Electric Jugs, Lucky Strike Cigarettes, NWS Channel 9, The Savings Bank of S.A., and Life Savers.
During this period, Marek collaborated with Tim Burstall on the animated film The Magic Trumpet (1965). The studio available to him also allowed Marek to make his first full-length film, Cobweb on a Parachute (1967) which Stephen Mould asserts


would, if it had been completed, hold a claim to being Marek's magnum opus. Unfortunately, a dispute between Marek and his employers broke out about the ownership of the film. The uncut negative was seized by Fontana, and all that remains today is a black and white work print, lacking the dissolves and superimpositions that Marek had planned. (p.11)


This marked Marek's break with Fontana Films, though he remained in Sydney until 1968, before returning to Adelaide. In Adelaide, he made another full-length film, the surrealist science-fiction film And the Word Was Made Flesh (1971), which Mould notes was made in collaboration with students from Flinders University (p.13). Marek had previously collaborated with students in Adelaide in 1963, when he used schoolchildren's drawings as the basis for his short film Windmills; he would collaborate with students again in Glide if You Can (1975), made with students from the Tasmanian School of Art (Marek had moved to Tasmania in 1973, and remained there until 1977).
Glide if You Can was Marek's last film, though he continued to paint, and also to lecture (in both film and painting), which he did first in Hobart (at the University of Hobart) and then in Canberra (where he was awarded a Fellowship in Creative Arts at the Australian National University in 1977). After a period touring Europe and the United States in 1979 and 1980 and a brief return to Hobart in 1980-1981, Marek settled once again in South Australia, establishing a studio in Eden Hills, where he died in 1993, the night before the official opening of the National Gallery of Australia's exhibition 'Surrealism: Revolution by Night', in which his works appeared.

Abstract
The final film from surrealist Dusan Marek, Glide if You Can was made in collaboration with the students from the Tasmanian School of Art, Hobart. According to Alex Gerbaz,It has a nightmarish, funereal quality, full of ghostly figures and unexplained deaths. Characters appears and disappear out of the blue, followed and watched dispassionately by others. Bodies are hurtled over rocky cliffs, or seen floating in a stream. A man tumbles down sand dunes; a frightened woman flees an unseen force, running first in one direction then the opposite way; four pallbearers cooperate wordlessly among the ruins of a castle. The visual eeriness is compounded by a dramatic organ score that makes occasional abrupt shifts in tone -- thunderous and abrasive one moment, sombre and peaceful the next. (p.3)

Abstract
The second experimental full-length film by Czech-born, Australian-based surrealist Dusan Marek, following from 1967's Cobweb on a Parachute. According to Alex Gerbaz in 'Innovations in Australian Cinema', And the Word Was Made Fleshcontains no dialogue or voice-over narration (except for a brief prologue statement). The tone is lighter than Cobweb, but the series of events is more intricate and bizarre. One of the most striking shots (repeated with variations) shows a bearded anthropologist writhing and falling down sand dunes; filmed in reverse, he seems to be falling up instead of down. The camera's poetic use of framing and space, its exploration of the nooks inside empty houses, and its occasional unexpected movements from side to side help create a compelling visual style. The music, while used sparsely, adds a rich texture: a flute-and-guitar melody in a strange scale starts up suddenly to indicate madness or obsession; a percussive tune with rattling bottles and light bells accompanies the pursuit of the anthropologist by two faceless men. Occasionally, the film evokes Woman in the Dunes (Teshigahara, 1964), with its desert landscape, erotic, abstract images of locking bodies, minimalist avant-garde music, and intermittent shots of spiders and insects.In his overview of Australian and New Zealand horror films, Robert Hood says of And the Word Was Made Flesh,
A surrealistic experimental film intended to show, according to Marek, 
""man's attempt to retain his inside freedom ... and not be moulded by 
the outside"". A scientist finds a cocoon. An idealised woman comes out 
of it. She is harassed by two faceless monsters who are collecting 
specimens for a museum. She and the scientist make love on a vast 
stretch of sand, while a killer stalks them. Make sense of it if you 
can.Sources:Gerbaz, Alex. 'Innovations in Australian Cinema: An Historical Outline of Australian Experimental Film'. Journal of the National Film and Sound Archive, Australia 3.1 (2008): 1-12.

Abstract
The first full-length film by Czech-born, Australian-based surrealist Dusan Marek. The National Library of Australia describes Cobweb on a Parachute as follows:
Combining animation with live action this is one of the few truly surreal works to emerge in the Australian cinema, an intensely personal reflection, by Czech artist Dusan Marek, on the importance of maintaining an inner freedom. Marek is the film's solitary character - the artist and his alter-ego who wears a de Chirico-like mask. The spare commentary poetically alludes to the artist's conflict with his subconscious culminating in liberation. The images are assembled in a manner akin to music. Marek hoped that this would allow viewers to maintain contact with their imaginations.According to Alex Gerbaz, in his 'Innovations in Australian Cinema', the film was shot on offcuts of film provided by Fontana Films, after they hired Marek to produce animated advertisements:
Although Cobweb was left 'unfinished' -- his original print went missing before he could add superimpositions and other effects -- Marek worked on it for a full year, and the resulting 1-hour film is one of his most ambititous and personal works. From its haunting opening shots of a man (Marek) standing rigid in front of a door, Cobweb possesses an enigmatic and dreamlike atmosphere. Marek's character is followed by a man with a featureless, wooden head. He is initially afraid, but the thought keeps occurring to him: 'If you kill me, you will die.' The two individuals are inseparable, a fact alluded to by the compelling image of two snails twisting around each other, accompanied by a drumming sound like a heartbeat. After a time, the idea of having a mysterious double becomes less frightening: 'Suddenly', Marek narrates in a thick accent, 'I stop being conscious of his presence.' The film now makes a significant shift, as we see a very relaxed and casually dressed Marek in his studio, looking over storyboards and animation cut-outs. The wooden-headed man appears again out of the blue, but Marek is calm rather than horrified. He puts his double to work, showing him how to operate the film equipment. A short cut-out animation sequence follows, after which Marek inserts a key into a heavy spherical object. 'He exists only within me', Marek narrates, and proclaims himself 'free', part of nature, and 'full of excitement!'Sources:Gerbaz, Alex.

Abstract
A short film made by surrealist Dusan Marek after he settled in Adelaide, Windmills is based on drawings made by Adelaide schoolchildren, which Marek then animated. Alex Gerbaz describes it as 'a bright colour animation film with dark undertones':Marek creates a surreal tale of a small boy who goes exploring at night. The townsfolk are negatively affected by his nocturnal presence: a weightlifter is struck and killed by an arrow, and his weights become light and float away; someone carrying a rock suddenly finds it floating upwards and then it lands on his head; another man shrinks into his hat and disappears. Finally a ship crashes with the boy on board, but he is revived by birds. (p.2)

Abstract
One of the longer films by surrealist Dusan Marek, made after his return to Sydney from New Guinea, Adam and Eve is an exploration of the biblical creation myth.
According to Alex Gerbaz,it depicts the creation of the first man and woman out of dots, circles and lines. The couple have scores of children, distribute the little dots all over the place, and reserve a few to put into their pram. Suddenly, the prams starts to shake violently and there is an enormous explosion. Marek's face flashes on screen, after which we see him as creator/animator reconstructing the world. The soundtrack, semi-improvised with Ian Davidson, is one of Marek's most inventive, incorporating muffled orchestral music that floats in and out, strange bird-like noises, backwards tones, ominous drumming and whirring, and a woman singing. (p.2)The film is made in the cut-out animation on which Marek was focusing in the early 1960s.

Abstract
A short animated film from surrealist Dusan Marek. The plot is described by the National Film and Sound Archive (NFSA) as follows: 'While a man is fishing, two men go over the wall landing in a boat below. The fisherman follows the other two down, but lands in the boat head first causing a leak. They all sink. The end.'
Though the NFSA does not make it explicit that this film is based on a nursery rhyme (as it does for Marek's other nursery-rhyme films), the title and the NFSA's description of the plot strongly suggest that the film is based on the English nursery rhyme commonly called either 'The Three Wise Men of Gotham' or 'The Three Sailors of Gotham', which plays on the reputed foolishness of the inhabitants of the village of Gotham, in Nottinghamshire:Three wise men of Gotham,
They went to sea in a bowl,
And if the bowl had been stronger
My song had been longer.

According to the National Film and Sound Archive's catalogue entry for this film, it depicts 'a feud between Taffy and another man, who ends up setting Taffy's clothes on fire and getting blown up '. Based on this description and the title, the film is most likely a variant of the anti-Welsh English nursery rhyme 'Taffy Was a Welshman', which appears in a number of variants.

Abstract
Between 1958 and 1960, surrealist Dusan Marek made a series of short animated films based on nursery rhymes. Some bibliographical sources list these films individually, while others list them as a series under the loose (but apparently unofficial) title Nursery Rhymes. Following the latter pattern acknowledges that there is some conceptual and thematic connection between these works, whether or not the film-maker conceived them as a series.Conversely, Stephen Mould suggests that Marek made a film called 8 Nursery Rhymes in 1959-1960, but this reading doesn't take into account the additional nusery-rhyme films held in the National Film and Sound Archive, nor the fact that some of the films have a 1958 publication date. It is possible that some of the individual entries in the NFSA catalogue represent variants of the same film (such as the two films entered as 'Tom the Piper's Son' and 'Piper and Pigs'), but even omitting such examples leaves more than eight individual titles with clear connections to nursery rhymes.

Abstract
Made during a brief sojourn in Adelaide during the five years in which Marek was based in New Guinea (1954 to 1959), Spaceman Number One is an animated film that follows the quirky adventures of the titular astronaut.
According to Stephen Mould, 'this was Marek's first use of two-dimensional cut-out animation and was the precursor of an intense period of involvement with animated film in the early 1960s' (p.11).

Abstract
A short film made using puppets, Nightmare (otherwise known as The Magician) was the only significant work completed by surrealist Dusan Marek during the period he spent living in New Guinea (between 1954 and 1959), which Stephen Mould notes was 'a significant fallow period in comparison to the constant need to work and create that marks the rest of his adult life' (p.10).
Alex Gerbaz describes the film as follows:the narrative begins when a stranger with a menacing appearance turns up at a pub, where the locals start dying in suspicious circumstances. There are amusing touches throughout the film: a headline in the local newspaper reads, 'Nothing New Today'; the stranger drinks sulphuric acid like it's whisky and fiddles with the eyes that have popped out of a man's head. The puppets, which move slowly and deliberately, are wonderfully crafted, with big noses and foreheads and mistrustful eyes. (p.2)

Abstract
Along with Light of the Darkness, Fisherman's Holiday is one of surrealist Dusan Marek's earliest films, made in Sydney shortly after his arrival in Australia. Like Light of the Darkness, Fisherman's Holiday is an animated film (claymation), but Stephen Mould notes that while Light of the Darkness showed an attempt to merge European training with new Australian experiences, 'Fisherman's Holiday (1952) is a frankly nostalgic look backwards to his homeland. It is set on a bridge in a medieval European town, bearing a strong resemblance to the Charles Bridge in Prague. The storyline, laced with black humour, has a man fishing from the bridge, swinging his line and catching a passing cyclist, whose head he decides to use as bait. A friend appears, with a bottle of wine, and the nude female statue which was on the bridge is now replaced by the cyclist' (p.8).

Abstract
One of surrealist film-maker Dusan Marek's earliest films (made the same year as Fisherman's Holiday), Light of the Darkness was made in Sydney shortly after Marek's arrival in Australia.
According to Alex Gerbaz, the film is 'silent and mysterious', using stop-motion animation and plasticine figurines:Among its characters are a rubbery-armed man standing outside a milk bar, a girl sunbaking at the beach, a man who appears to lose his feet, and a prisoner whose face is intercut in the final scene with an image of Marek himself. (p.2)Stephen Mould suggests that the film (which he summarises as 'a series of visionary scenes loosely tied together by a story which revolves around a wizard-like figure who creates a large egg')  'demonstrates the conflict in his work - his established, European, surrealist style attempting to merge with the many new visual stimuli he found in Australia' (p.8): he notes, for example, that 'Blocks of apartments, reminiscent of centrla European cities hover above the streetscape, where one encounters an Australian-style corner shop advertising Peter's ice cream' (p.8).

Abstract
'Desert Lake is a book combining artistic, scientific and Indigenous views of a striking region of north-western Australia. Paruku is the place that white people call Lake Gregory. It is Walmajarri land, and its people live on their Country in the communities of Mulan and Billiluna.This is a story of water. When Sturt Creek flows from the north, it creates a massive inland Lake among the sandy deserts. Not only is Paruku of national significance for waterbirds, but it is has also helped uncover the past climatic and human history of Australia.The Walmajarri people of Paruku understand themselves in relation to Country, a coherent whole linking the environment, the people and the Law that governs their lives. These understandings are encompassed by the Waljirri or Dreaming and expressed through the songs, imagery and narratives of enduring traditions. ""Desert Lake"" is embedded in this broader vision of Country and provides a rich visual and cross-cultural portrait of an extraordinary part of Australia.' (Source: TROVE)

Desert Lake : Art, Science and Stories from Paruku



2013



anthology 


non-fiction 





Abstract
'This volume represents a brilliant fusion of Traditional Knowledge, origin narratives, Western science and contemporary art. It is based on ‘deep-time’ complex human–landscape relationships from a highly significant lake system known as Paruku in the south-east Kimberley region. Known on cartographic charts as Lake Gregory, it is the only co-ordinated drainage system that flows from the east Kimberley into the expansive linear dune fields of the Great Sandy Desert. The lake was once a mega-lake, many times its current size, reflecting massive monsoonal rains more akin to central Indonesia than the present Kimberley desert edge. It hosted an enhanced aquatic and avian fauna and was likely a highly attractive lake for early settlers — being surrounded by savannah woodlands and grasses with grazing terrestrial fauna. Indeed, it was at such major water bodies that peoples transitioned into the desert hunter gatherer adaptations we think of today as the ethnographic norm. They persisted in an increasingly arid landscape — with lakes as a chain of connection to previous pluvial states.' (Introduction)

BiographyHistory

×Bio changes summary
Close

Born near the river at Old Texas Downs Station Western Australia, Queenie McKenzie was camp cook and station hand. Her mother Old Dinah (q.v.) was a Malngin/Gurindji woman. The police made several attempts to take Queenie McKenzie away but her mother rubbed her skin with charcoal and strongly defended her on separate occasions and managed to keep her daughter on the station. 
While living at Texas Downs Station, Queenie became friends with Rover Thomas who is a renowned artist. Queenie McKenzie was committed to inspiring young artists to paint and to keep their culture strong, she was instrumental in establishing the first wholly owned art centre for Gija artists in the Warmun community. To ensure the continued development of future generations of Warmun artists, the Warmun Art Centre was founded in August 1998.
In 1998 Queenie McKenzie was awarded the Western Australian State Living Treasures award for her services to reconciliation, art and teaching Gija (Kija) language by the Western Australian Government.

(p. 100-107)






Abstract
'In 1979-80 the new community was confronted with the imminent development of the Argyle Diamond Mine. Sacred sites were damaged, and the people feared the effects of a large mining town nearby. Their attempts to use legislative rights were unsuccessful, the Sate Government of the day being firmly behind the mining company. This was a traumatic and divisive period'.
'Nowadays members of the community prefer to emphasise their limited gains in negotiating protection of some of the sacred sites and obtaining some recompense from the company. They recognise that they had no hope of stopping the mine, and are relieved that many of the potential effects have been contained by ADM's avoidance of a town and control of it's workers'.

(p. 76-82)






Abstract
'The introduction of award wages was used as a rationalisation by many of the cattle stations in this area for evicting resident Aboriginal communities. Some workers were permitted to remain, but many chose to leave with their extended families. The pastoral industry's miscalculation that the workers they required would remain without their relations caused loss of its stable workforce'.
'People moved to Halls Creek, Wyndham, and Turkey Creek (many Miriwoong and Gajirrawoong people were already in Kununurra following the flooding of Lake Argyle in the 1960s)'.

Abstract
'The storytellers emphasise that there were both 'good' and 'bad' kartiya, people who treated them with constant consideration, as well as people known for violent behaviour. 'bad kartiya' evidently had little risk of being found out. Police were represented in both categories, some intervening on Aborigines' behalves, others killing Aboriginal people on occasions'.

Abstract
'Queenie McKenzie grew up on a cattle station, staying away from the grasps of the authorities, who would take Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander kids like her from their families at will.
'As she grew up, she solved problems everywhere she saw them.  From building schools and teaching kids in her community, to saving a man’s life by repairing his scalp stitch by stitch.
'But deep down, she wanted to tell the stories of her Country. To preserve their importance.
'She started painting in her 70s – becoming the first woman in her community to do so – and realised the power of telling stories through art. And once she started, she never stopped.'  (Production summary)

anthology 


biography 







Abstract
'Bush Women is a collection of texts exploring the striking history of six Indigenous women artists from the Kimberley: from living on Country, to the arrival of Europeans, stations and missions, to the contemporary era of telephones and acrylic paints, their lives are as underscored by radical change as they are by the continuity of the Dreaming stories of their lands.Bush Women was published on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of a 1994 exhibition at Fremantle Arts Centre, featuring paintings by Daisy Andrews, Tjapartji Kanytjuri Bates, Tjingapa Davies, Paji Honeychild Yankkarr, Queenie McKenzie (Gara-Gara) and Pantjit Mary McLean. The contribution of these artists to the history of women's' art in Western Australia and to the expression of 20th-Century Indigenous lived experience is far-reaching and continues to engage audiences in contemporary exhibitions, collections and archives.'

anthology 


life story 







Abstract
The stories recorded in this book trace the oral history of the families of Warmun community dating back to the time of first contact and interaction with foreigners. Elders speak of that time by describing life on cattle stations and the way culture was maintained in an increasingly alien environment. Other contributors tell of the move to the present community site and explain how aspects of their culture are still maintained and transmitted by the people of Warmun community.

BiographyHistory

×Bio changes summary
Close

Archie Moore (born Toowoomba 1970, lives Brisbane) works across media in portrayals of self and divulged national histories. He questions key signifiers of identity – skin, language, smell, food, dwelling, politics, religion, flags – and points to errors in foundational intercultural knowledge, asking what are the outcomes of misinformation. His practice is embedded in Aboriginal politics and the wider concerns of racism. Uncertainty is a recurrent theme pertaining to his paternal Kamilaroi heritage.For the 20th Biennale of Sydney in 2016 curated by Stephanie Rosenthal, Moore recreated in Sydney’s Royal Botanic Gardens a 1:1 scale replica of Woollarawarre Bennelong's brick hut built for him by Governor Arthur Phillip in 1790. The inside of the hut, with dirt floor and lined with rusted corrugated iron, was an approximation of Moore’s grandmother’s (Vera’s) house in late 20th Century rural Queensland. Moore was assisted on the project by indigenous architect, Kevin O'Brien.In March 2017, Moore will present a major installation at Carriageworks, Sydney, commissioned for The National: New Australian Art, the first iteration of three biennial exhibitions, partnered by the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Carriageworks and the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia.Moore presented two solo exhibitions in public institutions in 2015: 14 Queensland Nations (Nations imagined by RH Mathews) at Tandanya National Aboriginal Cultural Centre and Les Eaux d’Amoore at the Samstag Museum, University of South Australia as part of TARNANTHI the inaugural Festival of Contemporary Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art (both Adelaide). In the same year he was shortlisted for the Western Australian Indigenous Art Award, presented by the Art Gallery of Western Australia.He completed his Bachelor of Visual Arts at Queensland University of Technology in 1998. In 2001, he was awarded the Millennial Anne & Gordon Samstag International Visual Arts Scholarship which enabled him to study at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague.Solo exhibitions include Blood Fraction, The Commercial Gallery, Sydney (2015); 14 Queensland Nations (Nations imagined by RH Matthews), Tandanya National Aboriginal Cultural Centre, Adelaide and Canberra Contemporary Art Space, Canberra; A Circum/Intro/Extro/Retrospective, Bus Projects, Melbourne; False Friends, Northern Centre for Contemporary Art, Darwin;  Les Eaux d'Amoore, The Commercial Gallery, Sydney (all 2014); Flag, The Commercial Gallery, Sydney; Clover, Boxcopy, Brisbane; Mussel, Higure Gallery, Tokyo; 10 Missions from God, Spiro Grace Art Rooms, Brisbane (all 2012); Dwelling, Accidentally Annie Street, Brisbane (2010); Depth of Field, Ryan Renshaw Gallery, Brisbane (2006); The Archie Comic Book Series, Fireworks Gallery, Brisbane (2005); Words I Learnt From The English Class, Black Peppers Gallery, Brisbane (2002).In 2015, Moore presented a major installation work in a two-person exhibition with Matt Calder, Re-locating the Land, at System Gallery in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.Group exhibitions include Sixth Sense, curated by Djon Mundine at NAS Galleries, Sydney (2016); Buruwi Burra (Three Skies) - Paddy Sims Japaljarri, Michael Riley, Archie Moore, at The Commercial Gallery, Sydney, The Subtropic Complex, curated by Tess Maunder, Art on James Street for Resort in collaboration with the Institute of Modern Art, Brisbane; Courting Blakness: Recalibrating knowledge in the Sandstone University, curated by Fiona Foley, The University of Queensland, Brisbane; SOUTH: Contemporary Art from Australia, Mexico and South Africa, Hazelhurst Regional Gallery and Arts Centre, Sydney; My Country, I Still Call Australia Home: Contemporary Art from Black Australia, Queensland Art Gallery | Gallery of Modern Art, Brisbane and Auckland Art Gallery (2013 & 2014); Mémoires Vives: Une Histoire de l’Art Aborigène, Le musée d'Aquitaine, Bordeaux (2013-2014); Experimenta – Speak to Me, 5th International Biennale of Media Art at RMIT Gallery, Melbourne and the University of Queensland (2013 & 2014); Transmission, curated by Carrie Miller and Dr Matthew Hindson, Campbelltown Arts Centre, Sydney, Contemporary Australian Drawing 2: Drawing as notation, text and discovery at the University of the Arts, London and Lie of the Land: New Australian Landscape at the Australian Embassy, Washington D.C.

Courting Blakness : Recalibrating Knowledge in the Sandstone University






2015;




(p. 118-123)






Abstract
'...The pathway led to the Forgan Smith tower and my eye was drawn to the five flags flying on top.  The five light posts that align the pathway took on an image of flagpoles in my mind, and I thought about the public's aware mess of the many nations that existed here before European arrival and the nationhood that has been rendered invisible for the past 200 and more years...'

Abstract
'A pandemic is racing through our world, changing people subtly but irrevocably. The first sign for some is losing their faith. For others it comes as violent outpourings of creativity, reckless driving and seeing visions.
'Scientist Charlotte Zinn is close to a cure when her partner becomes infected. Overnight her understanding of the disease is turned upside down. Should she change the path of evolution?
'As Australia is torn apart, reporter Brigid Bayliss is determined to uncover the dark truth behind the religious response to the outbreak.
'Brigid and Charlotte find themselves on the frontline of a world splintering into far left and far right, with unexpected power to change the course of history. But at what cost?
Dark, thrilling and compulsively readable, The Second Cure is a provocative debut novel about control, courage and belief.'

Abstract
'Murder is the ultimate crime. It touches the lives of ordinary people, casting its long shadow over the glossy cityscape and glamorous haunts of the sprawling metropolis. For homicide detectives Steve Hayden and Tessa Vance, solving a murder is a journey from darkness into light. An urgent, vicious confrontation with evil, a walk through the devil's own world.
'Tessa and Steve are the elite new face of homicide. She is young and brilliant, he is logical. She is instinctive, he goes by the book. She's complicated, he's down to earth. Together this powerful partnership must confront and overcome the intrigue, fear and shattered lives which murder leaves in its wake.'

Abstract
Set in a small, fictional, New South Wales country town called Wandin Valley, A Country Practice focused on the staffs of the town's medical practice and local hospital and on the families of the doctors, nurses, and patients. Many of the episodes also featured guest characters (frequently patients served by the practice) through whom various social and medical problems were explored. Although often considered a soap opera, the series was not built around an open-ended narrative; instead, the two one-hour episodes screened per week formed a self-contained narrative block, though many of the storylines were developed as sub-plots for several episodes before becoming the focus of a particular week's storyline. While the focus was on topical issues such as youth unemployment, suicide, drug addiction, HIV/AIDS, and terminal illness, the program did sometimes explore culturally sensitive issues, including, for example, the Aboriginal community and their place in modern Australian society. 
Among the show's principal characters were Dr Terence Elliott, local policeman Sergeant Frank Gilroy, Esme Watson, Shirley Dean Gilroy, Bob Hatfield, Vernon 'Cookie' Locke, and Matron Margaret 'Maggie' Sloan. In addition to its regularly rotating cast of characters, A Country Practice also had a cast of semi-regulars who would make appearances as the storylines permitted. Interestingly, while the series initially targeted the adult and older youth demographic, it became increasingly popular with children over the years.

Abstract
'In his 2006 thesis, “‘Staying Bush’ – A Study of Gay Men Living in Rural Areas”, author Edward Green described his subject as the “largely hidden and untold story of gay men living in rural areas”. That was a pivotal year for gay men living in the bush, with Australian television broadcasters platforming two of their stories. In the space of one 12-month period, this cohort went from “hidden and untold” to prime time. From as early as 1989, rural politician Bob Katter had been declaring that he would “walk to Bourke backwards if the poof population of North Queensland is any more than 0.001 per cent”. Analysing media and popular culture, this article explores the visibility and portrayal of rural gay men in Australia prior to and after 2006. In spite of Katter’s minuscule population estimates, the rural gay cohort continues to defy assumptions.' (Publication abstract)

The Second Cure

Abstract
'A plague with myriad weird effects spreads throughout the world in Margaret Morgan’s début, a speculative political thriller. The disease’s name is toxoplasmosis pestis: it causes people to develop intense synaesthesia, to act in impulsive and dangerous ways, or to lose their religious faith. In Sydney, scientist Charlie Zinn attempts to synthesise a cure, while in Brisbane, journalist and ‘political tragic’ Brigid Bayliss tries to ‘shine daylight’ on the rise of a far-right Christian politician who is exploiting his state’s fear to gain power. There is a lot to set up in the novel’s first half, and not all of it is done with equal grace. Occasionally, Morgan’s reliance on scientific jargon can be difficult to wade through, especially when she outlines the disease’s ‘genetic mutation’. A number of chapters are heavily freighted with exposition.'  (Introduction)

Abstract
'Inter-ethnic intimacy is on the rise in Australia, bringing an unprecedented level of ethnic diversity into our homes. Yet analyses of media representations of ethnic diversity have concentrated on the community level, neglecting the intimate sphere of family life. This paper explores the possibilities and limits of love within and across ethnic boundaries on fictional Australian television programmes. The results of a nine-week content analysis reveal a mixed picture. Inter-ethnic intimacy was regularly portrayed; but committed, long-term relationships across ethnic boundaries (marriage and co-habitation) were scarce. And although Australian television producers did not shy away from portraying physical intimacy across ethnic boundaries, emotional intimacy was often absent. Overt stereotyping of ethnic minority characters involved in inter-ethnic relationships was rare – instead, ethnic differences were downplayed or erased. Storylines were underpinned by the assimilation of inter-ethnic couples – in all their diversity – into the (white) mainstream.' (Publication abstract)

Abstract
'For much of its history in the twentieth century, television was conceived mostly in national terms. American television, British television, Australian television and so on were thought of as distinct systems, even if they frequently displayed significant degrees of overlap. Such a notion has always been a convenient simplification. Television exists at a series of different spatial levels and the nationwide tier is only one of these. Recent interest in the notion of media capital draws attention to the role played by broadcasting hubs in larger television formations, not only in the industrial sense of resource accumulation and density but also in terms of colonizing larger media environments. This paper addresses this matter in terms of the role that a Sydney metropolitan television service has played in the life of the Australian nation. It surveys the material and ideological dimension of this service as a means of further problematizing the connection of television and nation' (Author's abstract)

Southern Stars and Secret Lives : International Exchange in Australian Television

(p. 51-67)






Abstract
'The Secret Life of Us is a 'high end' television drama series, defined by 'adult themes, sexual references and low-level coarse language', first screened in Australia and the United Kingdom in mid-2001, and surviving for four seasons until late 2005.
 Developed by Southern Star, with the Ten Network, and Optus Television 
(a US-based pay TV service), it was the first Australian drama series to
 be commissioned by the United Kingdom's Channel 4. Eighty-six episodes 
were screened prior to cancellation. At the peak of its popularity, the 
series had been sold into a dozen or so (mostly European) territories, 
and against the usual odds, secured airtime in the United States, where 
it was picked up by Trio, a small west-coast cable network. It gained 
positive critical recognition, and fared well at television markets 
worldwide.
 Back in Australia, commentators linked the show with the return of the 
Ten Network to 'credible' drama after a hiatus of two decades (Sams 2001, 37), and with the emergence of a 'sophisticated and quirky' youth sub-genre (Idato 2000,
 2), before enthusiasm cooled around series two and three, and series 
four drew the by now largely neglected narrative to its almost unnoticed
 conclusion.
 The project offers a suggestive case study of momentary trends in 
domestic drama production, within material received as confidently 
articulating Australia's globalizing television culture at the 
millennium, inviting exploration of what John Hartley (1992, 102) has 
seen as the fundamental 'impurity' of national television, and the 
productivity of its identification as a 'fundamental criterion for 
cultural studies'.' (Author's introduction p. 51)

Abstract
'Investigations into the construction  of  Australianness are not new. From  the  1970s,  Australianness,  embodied in the bronzed Anzac, has been criticised  as  reflecting  only  a  limited masculine view, ignoring women, Aborigines  and  Australia’s  multicultural society.  Arguments  about  the  validity of the characterisation were developed in response to Russell Ward’s thesis that the typical Australian need not be the average Australian, and that a valid construction  of  Australianness  could  be based  on  a  legend  which  has  its  roots in pre-1851 Australia.'

Rufus Morris was a cartoonist, watercolour artist and children's book illustrator. His illustrations in children's books reflect both his rural background and comic art techniques. 
Morris contributed cartoons to the Bulletin and to the 'It's moments like these...' campaign to promote the Australian confectionary Minties. The campaign was successfully promoted through various forms of media between 1927 and the 1940s, including newspapers and the radio. Other children's illustrators that submitted cartoons for this campain include Dick Alderton (q.v.), Hugh McCrae (q.v.), David Henry Souter (q.v.) and Dorothy Wall (q.v.). Rufus Morris depicted country lifestyles and rural activities for his Minties Moments contributions.
Morris was also an accomplished watercolourist and held solo exhibitions in Brisbane between 1946 and 1951.

BiographyHistory

×Bio changes summary
Close

Albert Namatjira was born at Ntaria on the Finke River in central Australia on land which was then part of the Hermannsburg Lutheran Mission. His parents, Namatjira and Ljukutja, were Western Aranda people. Originally, Namatjira was known only by the name Albert, but when he began exhibiting art work in the 1930s, he took his father's traditional name as his surname.Namatjira married at the age of eighteen, and the family lived away from the Mission for several years while Namatjira worked as a camel driver and as a ringer on a cattle property. After moving back to the Mission in 1923 with his wife, Namatjira became involved with the Mission's craft workshops, creating pieces that were sold to visitors to raise money for the Mission. Namatjira began painting in the mid-1930s, after only a few weeks' instruction from a visiting artist who gave art lessons in exchange for Namatjira camel-driving services.Namatjira exhibited his work in numerous solo exhibitions throughout the 1940s and developed critical reception; however, when he applied for a Northern Territory grazing lease in 1949 it was rejected. In 1951, he attempted to buy suburban land in Darwin on which to build a home but again prejudice and hostility thwarted his attempts.In 1957, Namatjira and his wife were granted full Australian citizenship and no longer considered wards of the state. This meant they were allowed to own property, vote and buy alcohol. His work was being exhibited overseas as well around Australia. However, in 1958, Namatjira was sentenced to three months' jail for leaving alcohol in a place that made it accessible to other Aboriginal people who, under Northern Territory law, were not allowed to be supplied alcohol. He died of heart failure within months of being released from incarceration.Many of Namatjira's descendants are also painting and he inspired a major water colour painting movement in Central Australia.

Abstract
'Destined to be regarded as the most authoritative, thoroughly researched and most comprehensively illustrated monograph on Namatjira for years to come, Ken McGregor’s eagerly-awaited The life and times of Albert Namatjira is an insightful study of the man and his art, produced in close consultation with the Namatjira family and Namatjira Legacy Trust.
'The substantial text (which includes photographic illustrations) occupies the first 170 pages, and follows Namatjira from his early life at Hermannsburg and his ostracism for marrying a woman of the wrong skin group, to his association with Rex Battarbee and the development of a distinctive painting style which led to his first solo exhibition in Melbourne in 1938; it investigates the artist’s response to public acclaim and the consequences that ensued from commercial success, his struggles against bureaucracy and exploitation, and the sadness and alienation of his final days at Morris Soak.
'The next 250 pages illustrate over 450 works from across Namatjira’s career chronologically (many of the key works are illustrated full-page) in three discrete sections: Catalogue of Works of the 1930s; Catalogue of Works of the 1940s; Catalogue of Works of the 1950s. These stunning colour plates are followed by two short chapters, Solo Exhibitions and Selected Group Exhibitions. There is also a bibliography and an index.' (Publication summary)

Abstract
'Award-winning artist Vincent Namatjira tells the life story of his great-grandfather, Albert Namatjira, one of Australia’s most iconic artists.
'Vincent’s witty and moving paintings are accompanied by evocative text, which records the pivotal moments in Albert’s life. In telling his great-grandfather’s story, Vincent builds a compelling picture of the times and conditions in which Albert lived and worked, capturing his triumphs and tragedy against a backdrop of social change and historical injustices.
'This poignant children’s book provides an important tool for discussion about Australia’s art history, and a launching pad for exploration of the key moments in Australia’s Aboriginal Rights movement.
'Albert Namatjira is a unique children’s picture book of both artistic beauty and historical importance, and will appeal to children, art collectors and those looking for a special gift.
'The artwork in this book is part of a body of work called ‘Albert’s Story’ that was acquired by QAGOMA - Queensland Art Gallery/Gallery of Modern Art.' (Publication summary)

Abstract
'The paper examines the presence of Aboriginal art, its contact with colonial and federation Australian art to prove that silencing of this art from the official identity narrative and art histories also served elimination of Aboriginal people from national and identity discourse. It posits then that the recently observed acceptance and popularity as well as incorporation of Aboriginal art into the national Australian art and art histories of Australian art may be interpreted as a sign of indigenizing state nationalism and multicultural national identity of Australia in compliance with the definition of identity according to Anthony B. Smith.' (Publication abstract)

Abstract
'Aboriginal Australian artist Albert Namatjira resists identification. Was Namatjira a product of Australia's assimilation, a ""mimic man"" who adopted a Western referential frame, or was his trajectory the product of a ""split identity,"" as alleged during his lifetime? Can Namatjira's watercolours be viewed as a critique of Eurocentrism? This article seeks to revisit the nature of Namatjira's legacy in light of the recent retrocession of the artist's copyright.' (Publication abstract)

Abstract
'Alice Springs, 28 September 1958: Albert Namatjira, first Australia’s first citizen, enjoying a quiet drink with his mates down at the local. That’s Albert on the left of the photo, hand in pocket standing alone appearing bemused – the man whom fellow painter Charles Blackman said had the saddest eyes he’d ever seen – looking through the crowded room into the distance. For over a year now Albert has been permitted to slip into the front bar for a coldie or two, but his wife Rubina, also a citizen – First Australia’s second citizen – can’t because she’s a woman, and his five grown-up sons, Enos, Oscar, Ewald, Keith and Maurice, can’t because they’re still wards under the protectorate of the Northern Territory government. It shouldn’t matter though, there are plenty of chaps to chat to here on this spring afternoon, including the couple of blokes from Sydney who have come up to the Alice to do a story on him for the newspaper down there. Albert’s back in the news, though since meeting his Queen Elizabeth a few years back his huge popularity amongst Australians hasn’t waned. Now that he’s been summoned to appear on 6 October – in just over a week’s time – to defend charges arising out of supplying alcohol to his cousin Henoch Raberaba, who as a ward also can’t have a drink with him in the bar today, the newspaper’s editor has deemed him worthy of another feature article. It’s kind of funny then, or so the journalist and his photographer mate may think, to take Albert to the pub as part of their shoot. Perhaps they’re just thirsty after traipsing around town for a few hours under the outback sun, or maybe they’re thinking of showing their Sydney readers that Albert is really one of us; after all, they’ve previously seen him hanging out with bronzed beach babes aboard a private cruiser in Sydney harbour and surrounded by a bevy of Olympic golden girls. Our Aussie Albert, Australian as Vegemite.' (Introduction)

'Albert Namatjira is cherished but strict copyright stifles his legacy
'In the 1940s and early 50s, Australia could not get enough of Aboriginal landscape painter Albert Namatjira. The former cameleer and initiated Aranda man from central Australia was the subject of three documentaries, his exhibitions sold out regularly and he was presented to the Queen during the 1954 royal tour.
'Yet the father of the modern Aboriginal art movement was 54 before he was quietly granted citizenship (along with his wife Robina and four other Northern Territory Aborigines) on May 13, 1957. Once he became a citizen, Namatjira could travel without government permission, drink ­alcohol legally and transact business deals for the first time.' (Introduction)

Abstract
'From the remote Australian desert to the opulence of Buckingham Palace – this is the iconic story of the Namatjira family, tracing their quest for justice.
'Albert Namatjira was a man caught between cultures – paraded as a great Australian, whilst treated with contempt. He was the first Indigenous person to be made a citizen by the Australian Government. The founder of the Indigenous art movement in Australia, his artworks gave many Australians their first glimpses into the outback heart of the country. He was widely celebrated, exhibited globally, and introduced to Queen Elizabeth.
'In 1957 he was imprisoned for something he didn’t do, and in 1959 he died, a broken man. In 1983 the Government sold the copyright to his artworks to an art dealer. Today his family fight for survival, justice and to regain their grandfather’s copyright.
'This is one of Australia’s most potent stories – illuminating the relationship between Indigenous and nonIndigenous people today, in Australia and globally.' (Production summary)

(p. 56-68)






Abstract
'Albert Namatjira gained public acclaim for his art at a time when Aboriginal people were excluded from full citizenship in Australia. His narrative provides a context to analyse the human impact of the assimilation policy and the official control exercised over Aboriginal lives, and how these were rationalised within the institutional bureaucracy. This paper examines the reasons for his popular success and analyses the discourse to reveal the racist assumptions that underpinned much of the artistic criticism Namatjira's work received. This paper demonstrates that the legacy of control and exploitation over Aboriginal artists from the Hermannsburg School is not confined to the past, and concludes that Namatjira's own legacy is profoundly important for the identity of modern Australia.'  (Publication abstract)

biography 







Abstract
Battarbee and Namatjira is the double biography of artists Rex Battarbee and Albert Namatjira, one white Australian from Warrnambool in Victoria, the other Aboriginal, of the Arrernte people, from the Hermannsburg Mission west of Alice Springs. From their first encounters in the early 1930s, when Battarbee introduced Namatjira to the techniques of watercolour painting, through the period of Namatjira’s extraordinary popularity as a painter, to his tragic death in 1959, their close relationship was to have a decisive impact on Australian art. This double biography makes extensive use of Battarbee’s diaries for the first time, to throw new light on Namatjira’s life, and to bring Battarbee, who has been largely ignored by biographers, back into focus. Moving between the artists and their backgrounds, Edmond portrays the personal and social difficulties the two men faced, while at the same time illuminating large cultural themes – the traditions and legacies of the Arrernte, the influence of the Lutheran church, the development of anthropology and the evolution of Australian art.

Abstract
'In a landscape where contemporary Australia continues to struggle with questions of how to reconcile its national identity with its Indigenous roots, with contemporary Indigenous Australians, and with how it imagines its future, this film explores the notion of friendship and the role cross cultural friendships have to play in reconciliation. It looks through the prism of the Namatjira family, who live in Western Aranda country in Central Australia, in exploring the notion and reality of friendship. The story of their grandfather, Albert Namatjira – internationally acclaimed watercolour painter and the first Indigenous Australian citizen – is iconographic and nationally significant to the Australian narrative.'

Abstract
'Albert Namatjira was a man of firsts: the first successful indigenous artist and the first indigenous man to be made an Australian citizen. At the height of his fame in the 1950s Albert Namatjira's shows sold out within minutes. If you didn't own one of his paintings you probably had a print in your lounge room.'He also supported over six hundred members of his community, lost two of his ten children to malnutrition, was forbidden to own land, imprisoned for having a drink with his friends, and died a broken man.'Namatjira is a whole-hearted tribute to a great man. (From the publisher's website.)

Abstract
During the 1940s and '50s, in Australia, many icons of Aboriginal descent rose to prominence, and were representative of the culture of the day, and of their own people. Some permanently influenced the minds of Australians, remaining famous to this day - others have been unjustly forgotten. (From Libraries Australia record.)

Abstract
'Yulyurlu Lorna Fencer Napurrurla (c. 1920s-2006) was an important pioneer of the Central Desert art movement. She began painting with acrylics at the Lajamanu School art program in 1986, and within a decade had emerged as one of the most original and highly sought-after artists in the region.

'This comprehensive profile of Yulyurlu illustrates her bold and expressive artwork, with its brilliant use of colour and ongoing graphic explorations of her Yam Dreaming complex from the Tanami Desert. Collectively these represent a major transitional moment in the history of the contemporary Indigenous art movement.

'Essays by Barbara Ambjerg Pedersen, Chips Mackinolty and Christine Nicholls.' (Publication summary)

×Bio changes summary
Close

Newton developed a fascination with photography while still a boy. Following Kristallnacht he escaped from Germany and fled to Singapore. When that destination became too dangerous he moved to Australia.
Newton served in the Australian army during World War II and established a photography studio in Melbourne after his discharge. In 1957 he moved to London with his Australian wife to take up an assignment with Vogue magazine.
From the mid-1970s onwards Newton divided his time between Los Angeles and Monte Carlo. He died in Los Angeles in a motor vehicle accident.

BiographyHistory

×Bio changes summary
Close

Sir Sidney Nolan, AC, OM, was born into a working-class family, left school at fifteen and two years later enrolled in the Art School of the National Gallery of Victoria. In 1940 he held his first exhibition of abstract paintings. He served in the army (1942-45) and was stationed in the Wimmera, a district that stimulated his interest in the Australian open landscape and the Ned Kelly legend. A visit to Central Australia in 1949 resulted in a series of paintings on the explorations of Burke and Wills, for which he won the Dunlop Art Prize in 1950. In the 1940s he was encouraged by John Reed, president of the Contemporary Art Society and brother of Cynthia Reed  whom he married in 1948. He illustrated some of his wife's books.
A member for a time of the publishing firm Reed and Harris, Nolan also became friendly with Max Harris and was one of the editors of Angry Penguins Broadsheet. He designed the cover of the controversial 1944 issue of Angry Penguins. In 1952 he met George Johnston, spent an extended period with him on the island of Hydra in 1955, and was subsequently portrayed by Johnston as Tom Kiernan in his novel Clean Straw for Nothing (1969). From 1950 Nolan lived abroad, returning to Australia at regular intervals. His two Ned Kelly series - inspired partly by the stories of his grandfather, a trooper in the Kelly era - are perhaps his most famous paintings. 
Nolan illustrated the work of Randolph Stow, Patrick White, Alan Moorehead, Colin MacInnes, George Johnston, Robert Lowell and Charles Osborne and designed the dust-covers of C.P. Snow's novels, many of which allude to his work. In 1972 he produced a film, Kelly Country, and co-operated in several films and television programmes on his life and work, including The Dreaming, Spinning Thing (1967), Nolan at Sixty (1977), Sidney Nolan: An Australian Dream (1982) and It Is of Eden I Was Dreaming (1983). He was awarded the Britannica-Australia Award in 1969, CBE in 1963, knighted in 1983; then awarded AM in 1983 and AC in 1988. In 1983 he also received the Order of Merit.

(10 issues)






Abstract
Because of war-time restrictions, Angry Penguins
(without a periodical licence) could only be published annually. As an alternative, the Angry Penguins Broadsheet appeared for ten issues during 1946, edited by Max Harris, James McGuire and Sidney Nolan. The Angry Penguins Broadsheet published work by foreign authors such as Dylan Thomas, Henry Miller and Jean-Paul Sartre, asserting the same international focus that appeared in the annual. Supporting the avant garde modernist stance of Angry Penguins, the aim of the broadsheet was strongly stated in the first issue: 'It is . . . the function of this broadsheet to attack bad art on the one hand and to attack those debased values in the community which demand and perpetuate bad art.' To achieve this aim, each issue contained reviews of books, theatre, cinema, visual arts and music sometimes gathered under the title 'The Critical Eye'. The selections of poetry were dominated by overseas authors, but Harris and McGuire made several contributions. When war-time restrictions were lifted on 1 March 1946, Angry Penguins was to appear quarterly, but the July issue of 1946 was the last. The Angry Penguins Broadsheet also faltered, ending its run in December 1946 (this issue edited by Harris and Harry Roskolenko) after issues failed to appear in October and November.

Abstract
'Muse and mentor, Sunday Reed was the founder of Melbourne’s Heide Museum of Modern Art, and the heart of a circle of artists that included the likes of Sidney Nolan, Albert Tucker and Joy Hester. In this world premiere MTC commission, Nikki Shiels (Home, I’m Darling) embodies Reed’s passionate and unconventional spirit, bringing to life an audacious fantasy of her fateful affair with Nolan, her unbroken devotion to her husband, and the devastating price she paid for living and loving on her own terms as a woman in mid-20th century Australia.
'Sunday Reed isn’t like most women. In fact, she’s not like most men. Outspoken, uninhibited, adventurous, she has a laser eye for the new – in life and in art. When struggling artist Sidney Nolan arrives at Heide, the idyllic utopia Sunday is creating with her beloved husband John Reed on the outskirts of 1940s Melbourne, what ensues will haunt all three to their dying days. And in the aftermath, Australian art will never look the same.'

Abstract
'This article presents results of research using the diaries of Sidney Nolan, recently made available by the National Library of Australia. In particular, it focuses on two matters relating to Nolan’s lengthy friendship with Australian journalist and novelist George Johnston: clarifying the origin of Nolan’s Gallipoli series, which is strongly associated with a period in 1955 and 1956 that Nolan spent with Johnston on the Greek island of Hydra; and secondly, providing evidence regarding a curiosity with the series of portraits known as the Adelaide Ladies, which Nolan painted after spending time with Johnston at the Adelaide Festival of Arts in 1964. With regard to the Gallipoli series, Nolan’s diaries establish that the origin of this series is considerably later than has previously been believed; likewise, our research suggests that the diaries support the contention that a portrait that has long been included among the Adelaide Ladies is in fact a portrait of Johnston.'

'The roads were empty because of the virus and sailing by at 60 all I caught was a glimpse of the wall and it was difficult to say for certain, but I thought the flag was gone. I’d only just figured out what it was. Months before, when I’d first noticed it, I was stumped. I had been walking the Villain, walking all over the suburb for hours on end trying to tire him out. Even then, plodding up the hill on foot, I’d almost missed it, clocked it late, had to haul back hard on the lead and retrace some steps.' (Introduction)

Abstract
'The extent to which the seventeenth-century Dutch 'discovery' of the great southern continent we now call Australia had a cataclysmic impact on European cosmology is open to conjecture. But it is certain that the historical failures by Europeans to 'see' or understand the realities of the Australian land, its people and its creatures — as evidenced throughout history - have continued right up to the present. Despite the inadequacies of European tropes, genres, classification systems and ways of thinking in coming to terms with the challenges of understanding this southern continent, northern hemisphere frameworks of thinking in the sciences and humanities still persist.'

Abstract
'Mark McKenna traces the ups and downs of another queer relationship, the oftentimes unreciprocated love of Australia's 'great' historian Manning Clark for the visionary he saw in White. He shows how Clark's monumental multi-volume History of Australia expresses greater allegiance to the preoccupations of Australia's 'elite' mid-century writers and artists, notably White and Sidney Nolan, than to the work of Clark's contemporaries in the academic discipline of history.'

'Digging through the myths around Australia’s most famous artist, many of which he created himself as a masterful self-promoter, this book is the biography that Sidney Nolan deserves.'In an authoritative, insightful and often irreverent biography that fully charts Nolan’s life and work, Nancy Underhill peels back the layers from a complicated, expedient and manipulative artistic genius. She carries the story from Nolan’s birth in 1917 to his death in 1992, tracing his early life, his experience as a commercial artist, his involvement in the Angry Penguins magazine, his painting and set design, his difficult marriages and friendships with some of the twentieth century’s most famous figures: Patrick White, Albert Tucker, Benjamin Britten, Robert Lowell, Stephen Spender and Kenneth Clark.'

Abstract
‘My first encounter with the work of Sidney Nolan was when I was a boy and was working on an Exmoor farm. An Australian gave me a book on the outback. It was illustrated with black-and-white photographs of a vast silent land that was mysterious to me and which compelled my imagination. Although I didn't know it at the time, the haunting photographs in the book were the work of the Australian artist Sidney Nolan. I came to Australia on my own at the age of sixteen in search of Sidney Nolan's outback. It was the most important decision I have ever made. I still revisit central and north Queensland and have many friends there. That strange and beautiful country photographed with the imagination of Nolan has been a deep and lasting influence on my life as a writer.’ (Publication abstract)

Abstract
'Peter Carey said he was inspired to write his novel True History of the Kelly Gang (2000) by an exhibition of Kelly paintings in the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art byt the famous Australian modernist Sidney Nolan. Nolan (1912-83) was one of the first Australian painters to achieve international recognition. Thus the story of the bushranger Ned Kelly, which had provoked an upsurge of anti-British national feeling in the nineteenth century, became the means of achieving international acclaim by Nolan in the mid-twentieth century and was used again for an international success by a New York-based, acclaimed (Booker Prize 2001) Australian writer at the beginning of the twenty-first century. This continuity of interest and its widening reception is remarkable not just as individual success story but as an instance of visual globalization or migrating images. Carey, I will argue, developed certain visual strategies in his fictional narrative inspired by Nolan's series which allowed him to make the Australian imaginary connected with Kelly available to a larger international audience.'

'So begins this long-awaited autobiography, in which Geoffrey Dutton embarks on an honest, controversial and brilliantly entertaining journey through seventy crowded years.
'His unusual childhood was dominated by the lavish lives of his wealthy parents who collected houses as well as books, although young Geoffrey was despatched to boarding school at a young age while his mother traveled abroad to enjoy a flirtation with the European aristocracy.
'His real education came later, in wartime. I've joined the air force, and as well as embarking on various amorous adventures, his risky low flying antics had him promptly locked up in the ""boob"".
'During the war he also began publishing poetry and was closely associated with the modernist movement in art and literature. Later I studied at Magdalen College, Oxford, where CS Lewis was one of his tutors.
'Since then Geoffrey Dutton has become renowned as a poet, critic, biographer, publisher and editor. In this masterpiece of literary autobiography he traces many journeys, from his sojourn in Cold War crazy Kansas to a wild and wonderful visit to Russia as a hapless victim of Intourist. Other travels take him through the Pacific, Africa, Europe and the Mediterranean.
'There are many intimate portraits of his sometimes volatile friends, among them the feisty Zhenya Yevtushenko, fellow flier David Campbell, Russell Drysdale, Arthur Boyd, Sidney Nolan, the precocious Robert Hughes, Ken Slessor, and Max Harris, eccentric survivor of ""Ern Malley "" Here too is the full story of the celebrated, quarter-century friendship with Patrick White which ended so bitterly.'

biography 







Abstract
'Patrick White, winner of the Nobel Prize and author of more than a dozen novels and plays - including Voss, The Vivisector and The Twyborn Affair - lived an extraordinary life. David Marr's brilliant biography draws not only on a wide range of original research but also on the single most difficult and important source of all: the man himself. Gracefully written and exhaustively researched, Patrick White is a biography of classic excellence - sympathetic, objective, penetrating and as blunt, when necessary, as White himself.'

Abstract
As a founder of the Angry Penguins, Max Harris was at the forefront of the modernist movement in Australian poetry. He provides a unique overview of the period of Australian cultural history of which he was part, recalling the ferment in the artistic community as writers, painters, and musicians struggled to find an authentic Australian voice; the uproar surrounding the Ern Malley controversy; and his friendship with Sidney Nolan.

Abstract
'Max Harris, Adelaide born writer, poet, critic, bookseller and newspaper columnist, who is widely known as the victim of the Ern Malley hoax and for founding the literary journal Angry Penguins. Max deserves to be acknowledged for much more than this. Angry Penguins only took up six years of his life. The hoax and subsequent obscenity trial were humiliating, but he learnt from them, regained his confidence and went on to become one of the most significant figures in Australian literary and art modernism. Max had a regular column in the Australian which was widely read, and his later important journals, Australian Letters and Australian Book Review were leading journals in their field. He pioneered many aspects of bookselling and publishing. Max was an inspirational figure …' (Publisher's Website)

Abstract
'Reg Mombassa has been a mainstay in Australian pop culture for more than 40 years, both through his band Mental As Anything and his iconic artworks. He painted his first landscape at just 15 and has developed an intense fascination with both wilderness and buildings ever since. He shares some of his favourite artworks and the inspiration behind them, which appear in a new book The Landscapes of Reg Mombassa. ...'

Abstract
'Reg Mombassa: Landscapes is a stunning retrospective of one of Australia’s most beloved and celebrated artists. Reg Mombassa’s work has been a part of the fabric of Australia’s pop culture for nearly 40 years with his irreverent take on life down under, but it is his unique landscapes that have earned him a place as one of Australia’s most influential and prolific fine artists. From the early days of his childhood in rural New Zealand, and around his adopted Australian home Reg has been documenting the landscape, oftentimes from cars and buses on the road with his bands ‘Mental as Anything’ and ‘Dog Trumpet’; always with sketchbook in hand. Now over 200 of his iconic landscapes have been brought together for the first time to provide an evocative portrait of our very antipodean landscape, tracing its forever changing geographic and social outlook.

Abstract
'Stuff. It's everywhere. In your bedroom, in the kitchen, in the lounge room, everywhere is full of stuff. I'm talking about the ordinary stuff like chairs and carpet and dishwashing liquid and toast. You know what, it's all got a story. And those stories are funny, exciting, astonishing and some cases may even be true. In this very special Volume One, I only have time to tell you the story of Shampoo, Peanut Butter and the Days of the Week. And to tell you the now forgotten nation of trapezia was where all things were invented.'

Abstract
'Biblical literacy is likely lower in Australia today than at any point since the convict era. General levels of familiarity with the Christian scriptures are difficult to plot precisely, but studies of Bible reading habits, and data on various forms of Christian socialisation, indicate a significant decline in Australians’ exposure to the Bible over the last half century.'  (Introduction)

Abstract
'Christopher O'Doherty, aka Reg Mombassa, has infiltrated our culture for more than thirty years with a unique, laconic view of our world ... and of his.
'His wit, sense of mischief and larrikin energy resonated in the songs and performances of one of Australia's most beloved bands, Mental As Anything, whose music became the soundtrack to a generation's misbegotten youth.
'His eye for the absurd and his unapologetic idealism captured another generation or three with his irreverent, frequently macabre and always distinctive designs for the original Mambo label.
'Yet long before he became a Mental or transformed shirts into collector's items, Mombassa was first and foremost an artist. From his idiosyncratic pop art to the delicately realised fine art landscapes and images that celebrate and elevate the suburban, his artworks are sought by collectors around the world.
'Who else could stage the biggest one-man art show in history at the Sydney Olympics? Who else could have Elvis Costello producing his records, or the likes of Johnny Rotten and Crowded House seeking his record cover designs?
'But there is much more to Reg Mombassa, as fellow New Zealand-born writer and painter Murray Waldren shows in this illuminated journey. Illustrated with almost 300 original artworks and packed with photographs, posters and band memorabilia, this is a true collector's item.' (From the publisher's website.)

Abstract
'Reg Mombassa has been a mainstay in Australian pop culture for more than 40 years, both through his band Mental As Anything and his iconic artworks. He painted his first landscape at just 15 and has developed an intense fascination with both wilderness and buildings ever since. He shares some of his favourite artworks and the inspiration behind them, which appear in a new book The Landscapes of Reg Mombassa. ...'

Lizard Island : The Journey of Mary Watson

Abstract
'93 kilometres northeast of Cooktown lies one of Australia’s most beautiful and secluded resorts—Lizard Island. Mary Watson was 21 years old and had been married less than two years when, in early October 1881, after mainland Aborigines had attacked two workmen at her absent husband’s beche-de-mer station, she set herself adrift in a cut-down ship’s water tank with her baby, Ferrier, and a wounded Chinese servant, Ah Sam. They died of thirst on an island over 60 kilometres away, some eight days after their departure.
'At Cooktown it was assumed that Mary Watson had been kidnapped and killed, and when the bodies were found some time later they were returned for a funeral which became Cooktown’s biggest public event, uniting the town in appreciation of her undaunted spirit. Mary Watson, whose diary describing their last days was found with the remains, became an emblem of pioneer heroism for many Queenslanders.
'In the meantime, however, a terrible retribution had been visited on the local indigenous people, whom the police were quick to assume had been responsible for the deaths.'

Aboriginal Women’s Portraiture : Margaret Olley and Julie Dowling

Abstract
'Portraits of Australian Aboriginal women have historically reflected artistic styles, changing perceptions and the unique characteristics of the individual artist, but it was not until the 1950s that Aboriginal women began to be presented by Australian portraitists in a more humanistic and holistic way. In the 1960s, a shift took place in the way Aboriginal women were portrayed, when the Australian artist Margaret Olley [1923-2011] focused upon Aboriginal women differently. She imaged Aboriginal women in terms of painterly aesthetics, ignoring the societal, racial and historical meanings that could have been symbolically attached to her imagery if she had chosen to do so. This article focuses firstly on Olley’s contribution and its interpretation by the Gamilaroi art historian, Donna Leslie. It then extends the investigation of Aboriginal women's portraiture in contemporary Australian art through the exploration of a select group of paintings by the portraitist Julie Dowling (1969-), of the Badimaya people of Western Australia. This article is written by an Indigenous Australian author.' (Publication abstract)

Abstract
'I am writing in the front room of Murrays Cottage, where Donald Friend made his home for two years, until he left for Europe in March 1949. He visited again from time to time in later years. His friend Donald Murray remained in the cottage until his death in 1988, for Russell Drysdale and Friend had combined to purchase the cottage for him, Friend's stays in Hill End, and the extended stays by artist friends such as Russell Drysdale and Margaret Olley, transformed the almost deserted ex-goldmining town into the artists' colony it remains to this day. According to the local shopkeeper, the population of the town today is 117. In 1872, at the height of the gold rush, the population was anywhere between 10,000 and 30,000, depending on whom you believe.' (Introduction)

Margaret Olley : Far from a Still Life

biography 







Abstract
'Margaret Olley's life began in the tropics of north Queensland on a cane and dairy farm. But her family was soon on the move, first to the Tweed in New South Wales, then to Brisbane. During her last years at school, Margaret's artistic talent became apparent and she was encouraged to apply to study art formally.
So, in Sydney in the early 1940s, her life-long love affair with painting began. Here, too, she met artists such as Russell Drysdale, Donald Friend, David Strachan and William Dobell, with whom she would form enduring friendships. In 1948 William Dobell asked if she would sit for him and the resulting portrait won the Archibald Prize, just as she was setting off overseas. Bohemian adventures in Europe followed. 
Margaret travelled - sketch book in hand - in England, France, Italy and Spain, and lived on a vineyard in Cassis in the south of France. But in 1953 she returned to Australia struggling with her drinking and was forced to choose to dry out or dry up creatively. Once she'd made her decision, her return to life and painting was joyous. 
Nowadays, despite a recent bout of profound depression, when not only did she want to give up painting but also living, she still produces magnificent art, donates to our galleries and entertains in her notoriously cluttered Paddington terrace in Sydney. 
This is a rich and comprehensive look at eighty-odd years of Margaret Olley - at her lovers and friends, and, of course, her painting. It is glorious proof that indeed her life has been far from still. (Publisher's blurb)

Abstract
'The music and mayhem behind the seminal sounds of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Models, Hunters & Collectors, The Saints, The Go-Betweens, Cold Chisel, The Cruel Sea and so many more
'‘The most obsessive, single-minded character I've ever seen, outside of the mirror’ —Nick Cave
'‘I first met Nick Cave … at Richmond Recorders in January. I appeared shoeless, red-eyed and late. As usual. The grand piano was overflowing with bits of metal, microphone stands, anything that wasn’t nailed down. “That should sound interesting,” I said. It was the start of a great love affair.’
'Masterful music producer-engineer Tony Cohen defined Australia’s punk and rock sounds in the late ’70s and ’80s. His long and celebrated career took him from the studios of Melbourne and Sydney to West Berlin and London’s Abbey Road, working with innumerable bands up until his death in 2017.
'In candid reflections, Tony’s decades-long relationship with Nick Cave and his bands – The Boys Next Door, The Birthday Party, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds – ­is well documented, along with behind-the scenes classic recordings by The Ferrets, Laughing Clowns, Models, The Reels, The Go-Betweens, Hunters & Collectors, Cold Chisel, Beasts of Bourbon, The Saints, X, The Cruel Sea, Paul Kelly and so many more.
'Half Deaf, Completely Mad is an exuberant, hilarious, tragic and triumphant memoir that reveals a chaotic genius who lived hard and LOUD.' (Publication summary)

single work 







Abstract
'My Salute to Five Bells by John Olsen charts the journey of one of Australia's greatest living artists at work on the biggest commission of his career. Member of the Order of Australia and Archibald-prize-winner John Olsen was an established artist in 1971 when commissioned to produce a mural for the Sydney Opera House. The process was at times intellectually and creatively stimulating and at others emotionally draining as Olsen battled ignorance-the mural was scratched with nails by unimpressed workmen onsite-time constraints and even silent judgement by royalty as he guided the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh past the mural under the gaze of the world's media. The result is a stunning aerial view of Sydney's harbour, populated with crabs and fish and squid, whose colours change as the sun moves across the sky.'This book features a full reproduction of Olsen's illustrated journal, one of the most spectacular art manuscripts in the National Library of Australia's collection. This richly illustrated scrapbook of thoughts, quotes, diary entries, original drawings, and magazine and book clippings documents Olsen's Sydney Opera House experience from his initial speechlessness at being asked to do the mural to his attempts to instil 'wacky madness, more humour' into it and his very palpable relief towards the end. Olsen's great intellect and creativity shine through in his lists of 'Things I like', haikus, and playful and poetic expression. His margin notes and reminders, such as 'You've got to interrupt the gestalt' and 'Remember Olsen vitality transcends pleasure', offer great insight into the artistic process of one of our living treasures.'

Abstract
'Tim Olsen is the son of arguably Australia's most famous living painter, John Olsen. Son of the Brush is his fascinating, candid memoir of what it was like to grow up in the shadow of artistic genius, with all its wonder, excitement and bitter disappointments.
'Tim's childhood was dominated by his father's work, travelling to Europe and to communities around Australia as John sought inspiration and artistic fellowship. Wine, food, conversation and the emerging sexual freedom of the 1960s wove a pattern of life for the family. It was both the best and worst of childhoods, filled with vibrancy and stimulation, yet fraught with anxiety and eventual sadness as John separated from Tim's mother and moved away from the family.
'Yet the course of Tim's life had been set by the experiences of his childhood, and by the passion for art he got from both his father and his mother (an acclaimed painter in her own right). He has made his life about art as well, though following a different path from his parents. Today Tim is one of Australia's most respected art dealers, with a knowledge of art and artists forged from what is literally a lifetime of close experience. Son of the Brush is a memoir about living in the shadow of your father, and what it takes to chart your own course in life, but it is also about the wider world of art, artists and the joy, excitement and sacrifices of the creative life.'

Terry and John Olsen met in Campbell Town, Tasmania, when in 1969, 1975 and 1976, John led residential Summer Schools for artists sponsored by Adult Education, Tasmania. Terry had an immediate affinity for John’s interest in eastern philosophy, knowledge of art, love of poetry, cooking and life in general. John Olsen's Notebook was based on Terry's notebooks, kept from the Campbell Town years.'

2014



single work 


biography 







Abstract
'This landmark biography by Darleen Bungey, the author of the celebrated biography of Arthur Boyd, graphically depicts the forces that drove John Olsen to become one of the country's greatest artists. An exhilarating book, both trenchant and tender, it strips away the veneer of showmanship and fame to show the substance of a painter driven by a need to depict his country's landscape as Australians had never seen it before.'Given access to his uncensored diaries and drawing on years of extensive interviews with both Olsen and those who have known him best, she explores his passionate life and follows his navigation though the friendships, rivalries and politics of the Australian art world. How did a shy, stuttering boy from Newcastle, neglected by his alcoholic father, come to paint the great mural Salute to Five Bells at the Sydney Opera House?'This biography follows that journey - through Olsen's early experiences in the bush, particularly a formative period at Yass (a time previously unrecorded), to years of cleaning jobs to pay his way through art school, to a milestone time spent in France and Spain - and traces his constant travels and relocations within Australia, including his epic journeys into the outback and to Kati thanda-Lake Eyre.'From a child who was never taken to an art gallery, who learnt how to draw from comics, we come to see the famous artist in the black beret, the writer and poet, the engaging public speaker, the bon vivant - whose life has been defined by an absolute need to paint.'

Activist.
In addition to his political work, Bill Onus made a short (nine-and-a-half minute) film in 1946: called White Justice, it was written by Onus about the Pilbara strike. The film was never released, and his position as possibly the first Aboriginal film-maker was rediscovered in 2021 (as covered in the documentary Ablaze).
He is the father of Lin Onus and grandfather of Tiriki Onus.

Abstract
'Ablaze tells of Bill Onus, a Yorta Yorta/Wiradjuri man from Victoria, a truly heroic cultural and political figure who revived his peopleʼs culture in the 1940s and ignited a civil rights movement that would, against enormous odds, change the course of history.
'Through rare archival footage, state-of-the-art animation, vividly created digital motion graphics and eye-witness accounts, Ablaze is the compelling tale – part detective story, part contemporary opera – of how Bill and supporters brilliantly orchestrated their campaign for equality through performance, entertainment, film  and sheer audacity outsmarted mighty forces seeking to destroy Indigenous cultures, languages, and communities.
'Ablaze is an enlightening film for today’s turbulent times.'

Lin Onus calls for the acceptance of new movements and expressions in Aboriginal art and warns that to judge Aboriginal art as 'traditional' or 'urban' 'assumes that Aboriginal art should remain static' and denies the artist a place in the development of Australian art.

selected work 


essay 







Abstract
'Buried Not Dead is a collection of writings on art, literature and performance, sexuality, activism and the life of the city. In these essays, written over twenty-five years, Fiona McGregor documents performance artists, writers, dancers, tattooists and DJs, some of them famous, like Marina Abramović and Mike Parr, while others, like Latai Taumoepeau, Lanny K and Kathleen Mary Fallon, are less well known. In capturing these figures and the scenes they inhabit, McGregor offers an expansive archive of art and life of a kind rarely recorded in our histories.
'Fiona McGregor’s immersion in her subject matter comes from a deep and enduring involvement in the worlds she represents. She came of age as an artist during an outpouring of performative queer culture, in a community that celebrated subversion, dissent and uninhibited partygoing, and in her writing she observes the shift from that moment towards new forms of cultural repressiveness. McGregor is a participant in her essays as well as a witness – she sees through an artist’s eyes and records what she perceives with a novelist’s insight. In excavating the lives of others, she reveals her own, and shows the possibilities that rest beneath the surface of our culture.' (Publication summary)

John Passmore attended the University of Sydney, graduating with honours in literature and philosophy. He was Professor of Philosophy at the Australian National University from 1959 until 1979. He had a distinguished academic career and was also a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Humanities, a Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences in Australia, a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy, an Honorary Foreign Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a Foreign Member of the Royal Danish Academy of Science and Letters. He travelled and lectured widely overseas but refused several postings in America and Europe, preferring to remain in Australia. His writings on philosophy include One Hundred Years of Philosophy (1957), The Perfectability of Man (1970), and Recent Philosophers (1985). He explored topics such as Man's Responsibility for Nature: ecological problems and Western traditions (1974), Art, Science and Imagination (1975), Science and its Critics (1978), The Ecology of the Arts (1979), Serious Art (1991), as well as works on the philosophy of education. The John Passmore Lecture is held annually at the Australian National University in his honour.

For the Term of his Natural Life





Patricia Payne

Wilton Schiller

( dir. Rob Stewart
)





Australia


:

Patricia Payne Productions

,
1983




Z1823507

1983



series - publisher 


film/TV 







Abstract
Based on the novel by Marcus Clarke, this is a relatively faithful adaptation, though Moran (in his Guide to Australian TV Series), tracing the connections between this narrative and various other nineteenth-century works, suggests that For the Term of His Natural Life ceases to have anything much to do with the convict cycle in the mini-series that extend from Against the Wind to The Fremantle Conspiracy. Instead it has a lot more to do with series such as Return to Eden. Indeed, in viewing the series, the viewer experiences a strong surge of pleasure not only in the narrative but in the handsomeness of the settings and costumes, and cinematography but most especially in the star/character recognitions.The program used a number of international actors (largely, Moran suggests, to increase saleability to overseas markets), including Patrick McNee (The Avengers) and Anthony Perkins (Psycho). At a cost of $5.6 million, it was the most expensive mini-series so far produced for Australian television, but was comparatively well received in Australia and distributed overseas.

'John Perceval, who was a member of both the Angry Penguins and the Antipodeans, had no formal training in art except for six months at the National Gallery School in 1949.  A potter as well as a painter, Perceval helped Arthur Boyd and John Herbst establish the AMB Pottery at Murrumbeena in 1944 and from 1949 to 1954 concentrated entirely on the making of pottery.'

An Essay on the Works of Western Desert Women Artists and Aboriginal Culture

NEW : Emerging Scholars in Australian Indigenous Studies

vol.

2015;








Abstract
'The works of Western Desert women artists, such as Kathleen Petyarre, confront the viewer with the embodied reality of Aboriginal culture. These works are intercultural expressions of Aboriginal ways of being, imprinted within the frame of the canvas. This essay explores the implications of Kathleen Petyarre’s paintings for Settler Australians, and the potential for such works to create a greater appreciation of Country. I suggest that the acrylic paintings performed by Western Desert women artists can be understood as both expressions of the Dreaming and as evocations of sensibilities to be experienced and felt by Settler viewers. With reference to Jennifer Biddle’s Breasts, Bodies, Canvas: Central Desert Art as Experience (2007), I maintain that the work of Western Desert women artists departs from the dominant modes of representing Country, Dreaming narratives and Ancestors – instead articulating bodily experiences and expressions particular to Aboriginal women’s ways of being in and knowing the world.' (Introduction)

Abstract
'Eastern Anmatyerr artist Kathleen Petyarre was born around 1940 on the Atnangker homelands in the Northern Territory, arid spinifex country. Kathleen Petyarre presents a stunning full colour retrospective of Petyarre's work to date. The framing essay by Christine Nicholls offers an account of Kathleen's life based on conversations with the artist over a period of years, and reflects the significance that the artist attributes to the episodes and events in her life that have impacted on her work. The release of the monograph coincides with a three month retrospective exhibition of Petyarre's work at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney.'  (Publication summary)

Abstract
'Both art-making and creating a ‘Narrative of the Imagined Future’ call on the imagination to conceive a finished object before beginning its construction. Both processes open a way into the unknown, where one searches for what could become real. In this paper I employ an auto-ethnographic approach to demonstrate the similarities between art-making and the writing of a self-narrative, referencing my double portrait, ‘Be-yond Becoming’ (which draws on van Eyck’s ‘The Arnolfini Portrait’), and the circumstances behind its generation.
'Narratives are powerful vehicles. As we tell the story of who we want to become we set ourselves to live out that story. The virtual is actualised and the imagined is made real. In this instance, I outline how a rupture in my self-narrative allowed another self-narrative to emerge. Art-practice guided me out of an episode of depression as I replaced my self-narrative of being a failed teacher with a new self-narrative, that of becoming an artist.'

Using Diary Writing : A Narrative of Radical Courage

Abstract
'This article considers the use of diary entries as primary source material in autoethnographic research. It examines how the act of diary writing can reveal a trajectory into, and away from, an experience of depression and how diary entries can provide grounds for conjecture about possible futures and imagined self-narratives. It describes how ‘radical courage’, as identified by Phillips, can displace suicidal ideation and bolster a new self-narrative of an imagined future. The article highlights the value of diaries. More than a source of raw data for research and creative writing projects, they offer diarists a safe place to explore and create alternative and productive selfnarratives. In their unedited state, they are a first-person, present-tense record of emotional states, showing how context and events impact upon an individual’s life. Diary entries can reveal to the diarist and researcher alike the beginnings of a new selfnarrative that is not yet fully imagined nor articulated. The article includes selected diary entries and reflections on depression as a lived experience to show the connection between radical courage and a narrative of the future. This narrative form – a narrative of the imagined future – is commended for its therapeutic potential as a cognitive strategy to build resilience. Through writing and speaking, the story develops as it is lived; by being lived, the story becomes embodied.' (Introduction)

Abstract
'Judith and Clifton Pugh met in September 1970. He was already a major portrait and landscape painter; she was twenty years younger than him and had just joined the Australian Labor Party. Their decade together was one where the boundaries between political, social and art milieus were blurred - a heady mix of painting, policy and pleasure that reflected the changing face of Australian society. With a unique female perspective on the times, this is as much about the emergence of feminism as it is a behind-the-scenes look at the Whitlam years. But there was a darker side to this successful partnership - for the first time, Judith reveals the complexity of a relationship haunted by wartime experiences'--Publisher.

Narrative and Voice in Postwar Poetry

(p. 108-121)






Abstract
Argues that ideology, particularly the concepts of the vernacular republic and the democratic tradition is central to the development of Murray's poetic style. The author sees in Murray's work ""the inseparability ... of language and politics""  and  recurring ""ideologically charged polarities: rural and urban, religious and secular, Catholic and Protestant, 'Boeotian' and 'Athenian'"".

Abstract
'In this article, I ask how the British nuclear humanities, and in particular literary studies, might turn towards Indigenous Australian artistic, literary and critical work on nuclear legacies. Reading responses to the afterlives of British nuclear operations at Maralinga by the activist-poet Dr Natalie Harkin (Narungga) and the artist Yhonnie Scarce (Kokatha / Nukunu), I consider how, for British scholars, interpreting Aboriginal nuclear texts asks particular questions of critical practice, drawing attention to empire’s intellectual, as well as social and chemical, residues. Such work invites a reflexive critical approach, attentive to what feminist and Indigenous scholars call ‘positionality’. In Britain, the places blasted and irradiated in the name of national defence have a vague, occluded presence in collective memory. This inhibited awareness of nuclear history, I suggest, has been shaped both by avoidant attitudes to empire, and also by strongly future-oriented nuclear imaginaries. By contrast, Harkin and Scarce draw attention to intimate, ongoing encounters with toxic legacies left by imperial and settler-colonial projects. As they celebrate the resilience of dispossessed, poisoned communities for whom nuclear apocalypse is an everyday reality, they emphasise interrelated forms of responsibility: to the past, to land, and to future generations. I discuss the important challenges that their art and activism present to mainstream nuclear cultures, and to the memory of empire in Britain.'  (Publication abstract)

Playground : Listening to Stories from Country and from Inside the Heart





Nadia Wheatley 
,
		







East Melbourne


:

Allen and Unwin

,
2011




Z1781087

2011



anthology 


prose 


Indigenous story 







Abstract
'""We use the bush as our school and as our playground"", says one of the many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people whose voices combine in this anthology of true stories about childhood, compiled from a wide range of memoirs and oral histories.
Alongside reminiscences of getting bush tucker, going fishing and taking part in ceremony, there are descriptions of playing games, building cubbies and having fun. The warmth of home, the love of family and the strength of community shine through every story. Freedom goes hand in hand with responsibility, while respect and sharing are constant themes.
The eighty Elders - both past and present - who have contributed their words or artwork to this book include many prominent community leaders, educators and artists. Their life-stories span the twentieth century.
Just as important are the contemporary stories told by twenty secondary school students. Although some of these young people now make their home in the city, their connection to traditional country remains the source of learning.
As we listen to these stories that come from country and from inside the heart, we find wisdom that could help us care for each other and for the land where we all now live.' Source: ww.allenandunwin.com/ (Sighted 25/5/2011).

Abstract
'Early on a July morning in 1983 I drove with Ruth Lipscomb from Darwin to Jabiru. She was visiting the school there and had offered to take me along. She picked me up from my motel around 6 am. Just before we reached the Alligator River, she pulled off the road and produced a flask of hot tea and a packet of sandwiches that she had thoughtfully prepared. As we stood by the roadside she drew my attention to the song of a distant bird. ‘People around here’, she said, ‘when they hear that bird know that a particular tree is in flower and coming into fruit’. I do not recall either the name of the bird or of the tree. But what has stuck with me was the sudden awareness of the importance to a hunter-gatherer people of their knowledge of the signs of seasonal change around them. They lived and still live by a calendar not divided into mathematically determined months and seasons but one they can read in the appearance of winds and cloud, in the songs of the bird life around them, in the behaviour of the animals, reptiles and insects, and in the flowering and fruiting of the plants growing in their country.

(p. 25-40)






Abstract
This chapter considers how children’s picture books represent the contemporary environmental position of sustainability to socialise young readers into becoming environmentally aware adults, who appreciate the interconnectedness of natural systems, recognise that sustainability has local and global implications, and identify actions that support sustainable futures.The chapter directly aligns with the cross-curriculum priority (sustainability) and suggests ways for engaging with texts in the classroom that draw on the general capabilities of critical and creative thinking.

Abstract
'Early on a July morning in 1983 I drove with Ruth Lipscomb from Darwin to Jabiru. She was visiting the school there and had offered to take me along. She picked me up from my motel around 6 am. Just before we reached the Alligator River, she pulled off the road and produced a flask of hot tea and a packet of sandwiches that she had thoughtfully prepared. As we stood by the roadside she drew my attention to the song of a distant bird. ‘People around here’, she said, ‘when they hear that bird know that a particular tree is in flower and coming into fruit’. I do not recall either the name of the bird or of the tree. But what has stuck with me was the sudden awareness of the importance to a hunter-gatherer people of their knowledge of the signs of seasonal change around them. They lived and still live by a calendar not divided into mathematically determined months and seasons but one they can read in the appearance of winds and cloud, in the songs of the bird life around them, in the behaviour of the animals, reptiles and insects, and in the flowering and fruiting of the plants growing in their country. ' (Introduction)

Abstract
‘'Just for Fun’ is Luna Park’s motto, but to any Sydneysider the phrase sounds more like an entreaty than a declaration. Few cities place their fun-fairs so prominently, but the Park’s position – under the Harbour Bridge, facing the Opera House – is a misdirect in a city with such an uneasy relationship with pleasure. It has been harried throughout its existence, and survives only as a carnival where most of the carnival atmosphere has been removed.' (Introduction)

Abstract
'Martin Sharp was not merely an artist of renown but a celebrity. His fame began in the early 60s with the launch of OZ magazine, followed by his time in the epicentre of Swinging London where he created internationally popular posters and record covers (mainly for Cream, for whom he also wrote a song). On his return to Sydney, he helped create the Yellow House, an artists' colony inspired by Vincent Van Gogh, and threw himself into renovating Luna Park. Based on extensive interviews with Martin and his peers during the last decade of his life, Martin Sharp captures Martin's charismatic character and unconventional lifestyle. It also celebrates some of his most striking images to provide a lively visual account of an unusual life.' (Publication summary)

Abstract
'Revisiting his colonial past in Sydney, academic authority on magic Archer Major receives threatening letters. He gets creepy bookseller Mac Arber to hire Plant to investigate their source. When the letters continue, Major imports Plant to Oxford and sets him up in college. Unreconstructed radical Revill is the prime suspect. He claims Major ran a secret service project to neutralize dissidents by black magic, and ruined his career. And Major's dope-smoking wife, Lucy, seems to be having an affair with Revill. Until he is found dead.' (Publisher's blurb)

 (taught in 2 units)




Abstract
Kangaroo, set in Australia, is D. H. Lawrence's eighth novel. He wrote the first draft in just forty-five days while living south of Sydney, in 1922, and revised it three months later in New Mexico. The descriptions of the country are among the most vivid and sympathetic ever penned, and the book fuses lightly disguised autobiography with an exploration of political ideas at an immensely personal level. His anxiety about the future of democracy, caught as it was in the turbulent cross currents of fascism and socialism, is only partly appeased by his vision of a new bond of comradeship between men based on their unique separateness. Lawrence's alter ego Richard Somers departs for America to continue his search.

Abstract
Within the theme of Australian Travel to Italy, the article will analyse images of Naples in Michelle de Kretser’s novel Questions of Travel (2012). It will begin with a short introduction to Australian travel and an outline of de Kretser’s journeys in Italy, as well as her comments on her Italian experiences (Trapè 2015). It will then move on to the treatment of Italy in her novel. I will analyse which views of Italy the writer presents in Questions of Travel in order to define her way of approaching and responding to this country. I will do this by focusing on her descriptions of Italy and will avail myself of the theoretical discussions of description provided by Philippe Hamon.Full Text PDF

Abstract
''In the 20th century the ekphrastic conversation between seeing and saying, betwern opis and lexis, really begins to swing (and I use the jazz metaphor advisedly).
'Both visual and literary artists experimented with new languages, languages of fragmentation and reassembly born of cinema and experimental photography, telegraphy and radio, newspapers and advertising, of the shocking impact of industrial weaponry during the Great War, of the discomfiting interpretation of dreams in psychoanalysis, and of the awful reimagining of the physical universe in Einstein’s theories of relativity. Dada and surrealism’s clipped dialect of collage merged with the literary avant-garde’s symbolist, free verse and stream-of consciousness tendencies to form a coherent (or deliberately incoherent) cultural domain.'  (Introduction)

The Case That Stopped a Nation : The Archibald Prize Controversy of 1944





Peter Edwell 
,
		







Ultimo


:

Halstead Press

,
2021




24387405

2021



multi chapter work 


criticism 







Abstract
'A lively and thorough telling of one of Australia's greatest front page scandals, involving key figures of the nation's art movement, politicians and business leaders, with William Dobell and Joshua Smith caught in the middle. Whilst World War II raged overseas, Australia's Archibald Prize, the wealthiest portrait prize in the world, drew huge crowds and torrents of gossip. This big illustrated book details the bizarre court case, the cast of odd characters and the aftermath, with informative context.' (Publication summary)

Abstract
'Sydney has for generations been well served by dutiful Englishmen: Governor Arthur Phillip with his understanding of convict servitude; governor Lachlan Macquarie, who brooked little snobbery and gave the town its initial architectural base; and in our time Edmund Capon who, as ­director of the Art Gallery of NSW for 33 years, enlarged and greatly broadened its cultural and civic ­influence.'  (Introduction)

BiographyHistory

×Bio changes summary
Close

Dr Christian Thompson was born in Gawler, South Australia, in 1978. He is a Bidjara man of the Kunja Nation from central western Queensland and is also of German-Jewish heritage. His mother’s family are from Gundagai in New South Wales.
As an artist, Thompson spurns classification both in terms of style, medium, time, occupation, history and heritage. His art practice is distinctive within Australia’s art scene – as an Aboriginal artist raised in the 1980s his work absorbs the influences of that time. His work explores notions of identity, cultural hybridity & history. Elements of pop culture, dance, fashion, performance and mass media combine with the relationship between objects, space and history. His work engages the viewer and challenges our understanding of Australian identity and what it means to 'be’ Australian. He has lived in London (2014).
Formally trained as a sculptor, Thompson’s multidisciplinary practice engages mediums such as photography, video, sculpture, performance & sound. His work focuses on the exploration of identity, sexuality, gender, race and memory. In his live performances and conceptual portraits he inhabits a range of personas achieved through handcrafted costumes & carefully orchestrated poses & backdrops.
In 2010 Thompson made history when he became the first Aboriginal Australian to be admitted into the University of Oxford in its 900-year history. He holds a Doctorate of Philosophy (Fine Art), Trinity College, University of Oxford, United Kingdom, Master of Theatre, Amsterdam School of Arts, Das Arts, The Netherlands, Masters of Fine Art (Sculpture) RMIT University and Honours (Sculpture) RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia and a Bachelor of Fine Art from the University of Southern Queensland, Australia. His works are held in major international and national collections.
Thompson has exhibited widely both nationally and internationally. He has participated in pivotal curated exhibitions such as 'Culture Warriors’ (2007), the inaugural National Indigenous Art Triennial held at the National Gallery of Australia, curated by Brenda L Croft, and 'Half Light: Portraits from Black Australia’ (2008), an exhibition of key contemporary Indigenous artists working in photo-media, curated by Hetti Perkins at the Art Gallery of New South Wales. More recently, he has exhibited work in the exhibitions 'Australia' at the Royal Academy for the Arts, London, 'We Bury Our Own', The Pitt Rivers Museum, Oxford, Modern Art Oxford, Oxford, Valencian Institute of Modern Art, Valencia, Spain, 'The Other and Me', The Sharjah Museum, United Arab Emirates, 'Hijacked III', QUOD Gallery, Derby, United Kingdom, 'Shadow Life' Bangkok Art and Cultural centre, Bangkok, Thailand, and 'The Beauty of Distance: Songs of Survival in a Precarious Age', 17th Biennale of Sydney, curated by David Elliott.
Thompson's work is held in major public and private collections including:
Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney
National Gallery of Australia, Canberra
Art Gallery of NSW, Sydney
National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne
Queensland Art Gallery, Brisbane
Aboriginal Art Museum, Utrecht, The Netherlands
University of Queensland Art Museum, Brisbane

Abstract
'Reflections on art and art history by one of Australia’s most distinguished and innovative contemporary artists.
'Credo brings together essays from different stages in Imants Tillers’ career, from ‘Locality Fails’ to ‘Metafisica Australe’ and ‘Journey to Nowhere’, and closes with an essay written especially for the collection, ‘The Sources’, on the artists and writers he has drawn on in his art. These essays express an aesthetic credo which has larger implications for both literature and art created out of the experience of migration. His self-coined concepts like ‘the idea of incommensurability’ and ‘reversible destiny’, his ideas about appropriation and the importance of reproduction in Australian culture, the encyclopaedic range of his work, and his orientation and re-orientation towards Aboriginal art, articulate an Australian aesthetic which constantly seeks connectedness between the local and the international, and a broader understanding of the complexities of provincialism. What he calls ‘the revolt of the margins’ is evident in the provocative nature of his writing too, in its wit and irony and intelligence.' (Publication summary)

Abstract
'In the early sixteenth century, the Italian Renaissance poet and philosopher Giulio Camillo conceived an imaginary structure for universal knowledge named The Theatre of Memory; essentially a classical amphitheatre that inverted the position of spectator and stage, turning the auditorium into a tiered structure that fanned into rows of encyclopedic knowledge. Imants Tillers makes no mention of Camillo’s theatre in his anthology of essays, Credo, but the structure could be a parallel schema for his own expansive project The Book of Power – an ongoing inventory of all the canvas board panels Tillers has painted since 1981, which totalled 102,663 by 2018.'

BiographyHistory

×Bio changes summary
Close

Formerly a psychiatric nurse, Richard Tipping studied literature, philosophy and media during the late 1960s and early 1970s at Flinders University. He was a co-founder of the Friendly Street poetry readings in Adelaide in 1977, and edited their first anthology. He worked for the South Australian Film Corporation for three years, then moved to Sydney. Living in Europe for several years, he interviewed expatriate Australian writers and began a series of documentary films on Australian writers (the Writers Talking series). 
In 1989 he moved to Newcastle. In addition to his work as a lecturer in communication and media at the University of Newcastle, Tipping has been active in several of the creative arts. He is also recognised as a sculptor and artist, and his work can be found in many public galleries. He has staged a number of well-received exhibitions, and has created large-scale installations for several Australian art festivals. He describes his work as 'concrete poetry', showing appreciation of words and letters for their aesthetic appeal as art objects. His Imagine Silence at the Greenaway Art Gallery (2007), for example, is a series of eight four-line poems engraved in basalt blocks. 
Tipping often presents his poetry in original formats. During performances of his poems, he might accompany himself on banjo-ukulele, jaw harp or didgeridoo. His expertise with the photographic form sometimes blends with his poetry work, producing 'photo-poems' as a result, and he has published works on Australian public signs. 
Tipping's poems are often comprised of short lines, and his spare writing style creates a staccato effect when the poems are read aloud. Often satirical in approach and political in content, Tipping's poetry has been called 'witty, inventive and lively' by the Oxford Companion to Australian Literature. Tipping's poetry has appeared in numerous literary journals, both in Australia and the United Kingdom. 
Tipping won the Harri Jones Memorial Award in 1972, and has been the recipient of several grants from the Commonwealth Literature Fund, the Literary Board and the Visual Arts Board.

Notes



Tipping compiled a series of volumes which he titled the 'In Public' series: 'RKT 66-79 In Public'; 'In Public: Richard Tipping 80-82'; 'TR 83-84: In Public'; 'In Public RKT 84-88'; 'In Public: RKT 1989-mid '94'. While these were reproduced in limited numbers and are available at selected libraries, they are not separately listed here as they consist of photocopies of works published elsewhere. The last of the series, however,  'Writers Talking', while it contains Tipping's published interviews with writers, also contains some original material, and therefore has been listed.

Abstract
'One art event that changed me was Chrism and Jean-Claude's wrapping of Little Bay in 1969. when I was 19 and had moved to Sydney for the year from my home city of Adelaide. Wrapped Coast, Chrism's first large-scale , was made possible by John Kaldor and constructed by a large tan of volunteers including art students whom my partner. Betty Ross, and I knew. We went to the site several times and walked all over the headland and foreshore as the white fabric was being installed. Its hard to appreciate the scale from photographs—it was massively massive. Although this installation art had nothing to do with language, I was inspired by its audacity and the way it drew attention to what was now not visible, making the ordinary extraordinary. This art said that it was possible to go beyond the confines and safety of the gallery, to think big, that it was okay to be temporary, and that the photography dart mattered.' (Introduction)

selected work 


poetry 







Abstract
'Hear the Art is the essential poetry-as-art collection, loaded with Richard Tipping’s elegant, wry and telling concrete poems made as sculpture and as picture. He is fascinated by words found within words, and articulating their iterations.
'Tipping works with poetic language in visual forms and physical media ranging from animated neon, slump glass, engraved marble and screenprint to large-scale public sculptures in steel, granite and electric lights. Typographic designs move off the page, becoming independent poem objects until -- while living in the artworld as things -- they are photographed, and return to the page. This book is full of realised ideas, a rich panoply of word art demanding to be seen, heard and remembered.'

Tommy Ruff : Adelaide Poems

2014



selected work 


poetry 







Abstract
'Tommy Ruff is a fresh catch of pointed poems from the deep south of Australia, by a poet well known for not fitting in to available categories. The poems date from 1968 to 1984, including previously unpublished and newly polished work, as well as forgotten favourites from four collections. Sensationally, ‘A Shoebox Full of Grasshoppers’ is illustrated with a diagram of the sexual relationships which inspired the story. Three typewriter poems hint at the direction which Tipping would take, becoming internationally recognised for his visual poetry and textual objects. Other poems range from the political to the poignant. At their heart is an appreciation of home ground.Richard Kelly Tipping is an original Adelaidean born in the year of the Chinese Communist revolution who lived in the city for thirty years before moving to the east coast. While in Adelaide he co-edited Mok, the first of a wave of small press poetry magazines which redefined Australian poetry in the late 1960s; graduated in humanities from Flinders University; helped start the on-going Friendly Street poetry readings in 1975; and held his first solo exhibition of word sculpture The Everlasting Stone at the Adelaide Festival Centre. Tommy Ruff is his umpteenth book.' (Publisher's summary)

selected work 


poetry 







Abstract
'The six poems in Instant History were written in response to the first and second invasions of Iraq, in the late 1900s and early 2000s. Terms such as 'shock and awe', 'pink mist' and 'data smog' were generated by this potential debacle, where the imposition of military might causes more problems than it solves. The poster inside the folded pages is a direct copy of a street banner published by the Newcastle Herald in March 2003, showing an Australian soldier in supposed attack readiness' (Bibliotheca Librorum Apud Artificem).

'Edited text of a set of conversations concerning contemporary Australian poetry and poetics, which took place in the English Department at the Australian National University in the winter of 1988. Present, not always all at the same time, were ...[the poets listed above]. The poets were asked, at the outset, to make a brief statement as to where they saw themselves and their work at that particular point in time.'

Abstract
'An ageing but respectable poet was once heard to utter these syllables when confronted with some of the new radical poetry broadsheets. Editor Rob Tillett endeavors to partially answer this pained question, but begs leave to inform those who already know that they may skip the essay itself and read only the last paragraph if indeed they feel so inclined. For those who know now, may it prove both inspiring and enlightening...' [Editor's abstract].

BiographyHistory

×Bio changes summary
Close

Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri is regarded as one of the most significant Australian artists of the later 20th century. He was one of the founders of the Western Desert Art Movement and is perhaps the best known of the 'painting men' who emerged at Papunya, a settlement ca. 250 km north-west of Alice Springs, in the early 1970s. A prolific artist, his paintings began to attract widespread interest in the 1980s, and since then his works have appeared in numerous national and international exhibitions, and have been acquired by all the major Australian public galleries. In 1988 he became the first Indigenous artist to be accorded a solo exhibition in Europe, when his works were exhibited at the Institute of Contemporary Art, in London.Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri was born on Napperby Station, north-west of Alice Springs, in the early 1930s. He spent his childhood on Napperby and nearby Hamilton Downs Stations and  subsequently worked as a stockman on cattle stations near Alice Springs until the mid 1960s, when he settled at Papunya. Although he was already a skilled wood carver, his artistic career did not really begin until he took up painting at Papunya in the early 1970s, under the initial tutelage of artist and teacher Geoffrey Bardon. As with the other Papunya artists, his works are particularly significant in that they communicate the custodianship of the Western Desert peoples over their Dreaming narratives and places, and reflect an affirmation of their culture.Sadly, Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri died on the day that he was to have been presented with the Order of Australia for his services to art and to the Indigenous community.

Listen to Ngarrindjeri Women Speaking : Kungun Ngarrindjeri Miminar Yunnan

			(editor),

Spinifex Press

anthology 


life story 







Abstract
'Ngarrindjeri women came to prominence in the 1990s with the Hindmarsh Island Bridge affair. Labelled ""liars"" in 1995 by a South Australian Royal Commission then vindicated in the Federal Court in 2001 as ""truth-tellers"", these Ngarrindjeri miminar have much to be angry about. But, they also have stories to tell about their lives and their visions for the future. Here they take us into their world of caring for their country, their families and their nation.
'What are our needs? What do we want to address our needs? Where are we going? What does the future hold for us, our children, our grandchildren, our young women?
'Their stories will charm and delight, and their stories will jar and shock. They ask that you kungun [listen] to their yunnan [speaking].
'When the Ngarrindjeri women of South Australia asked Diane Bell if she would work with them in the running of some workshops to develop a booklet about culture and governance, none of them realised quite where it would take them. This book is the result. It has developed from a booklet to a book that outlines their visions for the future. A future in which their culture is respected, their stories heard, their laws carried out.' (Publisher's blurb)

— Appears in: 
		








The Darkening Ecliptic






1993;




(p. vi-x)






Abstract
Tucker quotes from Carl Jung's Memories, Dreams and Reflections to posit a theoretical framework from which to approach the Ern Malley poems. Tucker contends that McAuley and Stewart were overtaken by their own creation and succumbed, in the words of Jung, to 'something in me which can say things I do not know and do not intend, things which may even be directed against me ...'.

Portraits of Modern Evil





Robert Reid 
,
		


2007



single work 


drama 







Abstract
Portraits of Evil explores the far-reaching and devastating effects of war from the perspective of Australian artist Albert Tucker. The play is set in Melbourne in 1942 as Tucker retreats with wife Joy Hasker to the farm of fellow artist John Reed.  This followed Tucker's harrowing experience sketching wounds and mental illness in a military hospital.  The fictional portrait sittings between Tucker and Eddie Leonski, an American soldier, are central to the play. Leonski was known as the 'brown-out strangler'. He murdered several women during this period while camped near Melbourne.

,
		


1993



single work 


criticism 








— Appears in: 
		








The Darkening Ecliptic






1993;




(p. 47-57)






Abstract
Wilson contends that 'Stewart and McAuley's afternoon of slapdash ""tachist"" invention produced work of genuine merit, which affords us a fascinating insight into the creative process'. Included in Wilson's article is the text of a piece he wrote for the Japanese publication, I.D. Magazine in 1991. The magazine piece recounts the events of the Ern Malley Hoax, quotes extracts from Malley poems and concludes that McAuley and Stewart, 'in trying to create a parody, ... produced the poetic equivalent of a Jackson Pollock painting'.

Abstract
Paddy Wainburranga of the Rembarrnga tribe from Arnhem Land relates and paints the Rembarrnga history of Captain Cook. Typical of contemporary Aboriginal accounts, this story offers a markedly different perspective to the history upheld by non-Aboriginal Australians. The 'Captain Cook' of the title, in Northern Australian slang, refers to white people.

BiographyHistory

×Bio changes summary
Close

In 1990 Judy Watson who is a descendant of the Waanyi clan was able to fulfil her life-long dream of researching her Aboriginal heritage by travelling to her grandmother's country in north-west Queensland. Watson grew up in Brisbane and attended the Darling Downs Institute of Advanced Education in Toowoomba where she gained a Diploma of Creative Arts in 1979. 
After moving to Hobart in 1980 she graduated from the University of Tasmania in 1982. Watson has also lectured at the Townsville College of TAFE and at the Gippsland Institute of Advanced Education. She has exhibited her artwork both nationally and internationally. In 2006 two of her works were permanently installed within the archetectural fabric of the Musee du quai Branly in Paris. Watson has also been a recipient of several contemporary art awards including the Moet and Chandon Fellowship in 1995 and the National Gallery of Victoria's Clemenger Award in 2006.

Abstract
'I Open the Door... contains nine interconnected stories, all of which begin and end with opening a door. The young author/illustrators at the 2016 Spinifex Writing Camp were encouraged to let their imaginations run wild, and the result is a book that will simply take your breath away. Prepare to be intrigued, surprised, fearful and delighted as you turn the pages to follow the adventures of what happens when a door is opened. 

'The Indigenous Literacy Foundation's motto of 'Reading Opens Doors' became the inspiration for the stories that were written at the 2016 Spinifex Writing Camp held once again at Tjuntjuntjara, this year with mentors Ann James, Gregg Dreise and Judy Watson. ' (Publication summary)

Exploring the plight of the dispossessed, indigenous Australians with whom she shares a family history and heritage, Watsons's works are divided into the seven defining elements within her artistic themes.

Abstract
'This paper explores stories of re-mapping the archives through art and poetic-prose, using ideas of haunting through ‘memory in the blood.’ Our family archives are like maps that haunt and guide us toward paths past-travelled and directions unknown. We travel through these archives that offer up new stories and collections of data, and a brutal surveillance is exposed at the hands of the State. We gain insight into intimate conversations, letters, behaviours and movements, juxtaposed with categorisations of people, places, landscapes and objects. These records are our memories and lives; material, visceral, flesh and blood. The State wounds and our records bleed. I travel through my own Nanna’s records and recognise that we have never lived outside the State, and this very act of recognition continues the wounding. State acts of surveillance, recording and archiving had the power to place ourfamily stories in the public domain, or obliterate stories within a broader history of erasure; filed away, silent and hidden until bidden. But our bodies too are archives where memories, stories, and lived experiences are stored, etched and anchored in our bloodlines deep. They ground our creativity in what become personal and political acts of remembering, identity making and speaking back to the State. Detective-like methods allow us to creatively re-map events and landscapes, piece together lives fragmented and heal our wounds.' ((Re) Mapping the Archive, 4)

single work

Abstract
'Heartfelt and hilarious, this is a book for anyone who has tried to imagine what their dog was thinking.
'Human beings often write about their dogs, but the dogs don't usually get a right of reply. In Love, Clancy, Richard Glover has collated the letters sent by Clancy to his parents in the bush. They are full of a young dog's musings about the oddities of human behaviour, life in the big city, and his own attempts to fit in. You'll meet Clancy as a puppy, making his first attempt to train his humans, then see him grow into a mature activist, demanding more attention be paid to a dog's view of the world. Along the way, there are adventures aplenty, involving robotic vacuum cleaners, songs about cheese, trips to the country and stolen legs of ham - all told with a dog's deep wisdom when it comes to what's important in life.
'With delightful illustrations by cartoonist Cathy Wilcox.' (Publication summary)

Abstract
'This scholarly and highly illustrated study of Fred Williams was originally published in 1980, and was the first comprehensive and fully researched attempt to inform a wider public of the significance of Williams' work. The author traces the artist's career from his student days through his years of mature achievement to the flowering of his art in the last years of his life. This third revised edition includes a new chapter, which looks at Williams' place in the Australian art scene and includes new insights into Williams as man and artist.' (Provided by publisher.)

selected work 


poetry 







Abstract
'Lines for Birds is the result of a rich collaboration between two distinguished artists, both long fascinated by nature's beauty and power.
'Containing lush images by acclaimed painter John Wolseley and words by award-winning poet Barry Hill, this dazzling book weaves together a conversation between two venerable artists who, in a world of endangered nature, celebrate joy.
'This remarkable collection captures the very essence of Bird - its energy, inquisitiveness and daring - and is proof that these creatures suggest new ways of telling stories about the Earth. 
'The book follows the flight paths and habitats of birds, from the Victorian Mallee to the forests of South East Asia, to Japan and the South of France.
'Lines for Birds is not only a beautiful piece of art, but is essential reading for lovers of poetry, visual arts and natural history.' (From the publisher's website.)
