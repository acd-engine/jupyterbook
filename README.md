# Australian Cultural Data Engine - Jupyter Book

This repository contains all the necessary scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and documentations needed to explore and process the data sources for the Australian Cultural Data Engine (ACDE). This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in the data processing of this project, providing a clear overview of the various steps involved in the ACDE construction, as well as the methodologies and tools used to carry out these tasks. We also showcase several examples of how ACDE's unified datasets can be used to perform quantitative analysis.
